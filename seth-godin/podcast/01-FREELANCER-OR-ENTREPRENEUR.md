## FREELANCER  OR  ENTREPRENEUR? 

### An Empty Lot  

I want to start by telling you about an architect I just read  about and  sort of  the  curse  of  the  successful  architect.  This guy  had  made  a  very  good  living  designing  and   renovating  houses for rich people.  His kids grew  up,  went  off to college,  and he and  his  wife  decided  to  move.  That’s  problem number  one.   Problem number  two  is  they  bought  an  empty  lot.   
So now the architect has to go and build his house. He has to build his house  without  being  able  to  complain  about  anything  because  it’s  an  empty  lot.   Most  of  the  time  I  talk  with  people,  who  because  of  circumstances  of  their  job,   
boss, or  wherever  they  are  working, have  all these  other  things  they  have  to  be   concerned  about.  They  don’t  have  an  empty  lot.  And  each  of  you  has  an  empty  lot.   That’s  number  one.    

Number  two  is  lots  of  people  have  the  ability  to  get  to  the  point  where  they  could   invent  the next  thing they’re going to do, but  they find excuses. By  coming  here   today  you’ve  indicated  you’re  past that.    

So we’re going to spend the first part of this session  assuming  you  are  all  in,   assuming  we  don’t  have  to  deal  with  the  stuff  that  undermines  our  best  work.   

Then as the days go on and we get  better at  talking to each other and trusting  each other about  where we are, we’re going to dig to the next  level  of, “If you see it,  is it  possible you’re going to do it?”   

### Getting Hit 

I want to start by  telling  a  story  I’ve  only  told  once  before  in  this  room a  couple   months  ago.   

I grew up in buffalo and  was  really  bad  at ice hockey growing up. In Buffalo there  is  no  baseball,  there  might  be  bowling,  but  mostly  it’s  ice  hockey.  

When I was  10,  my  parents  sat  me  down.  The  word  “nerd”  wasn’t  in  common   parlance and  they said, “You can be whatever  that thing is, but you also have to at  least play  a sport for  a while.”   

My  dad  agreed  to  coach  the  team just  to  make  sure  I  would  actually  do  this.  He   was  a  great  hockey  coach.  He  had  all  these  drills.  He  came  up  with  all  these   inventions. Every other coach had two pucks. My  dad  had  thirty  pucks  so  there  was   never  a shortage.  He drilled  a hole in the pucks  and  they all had  a shoe lacing so  you  could carry 30  pucks  at once and  stuff  like that.    
   


   
   
Anyway,  he  invented  this  drill  where  the  puck  is  over  here  and  that’s  the  corner.   They call  it  the corner, but  it’s sort  of round. One player  would  be here and  one  player  would  be here. The coach would  throw the puck in the corner  and  this  guy  would  have  to  skate  and  grab the  puck and  go  this  way  and  this  guy  would  have  to   go that way. What we were supposed to do is go as fast as you can and  hit the  other   guy  and  stuff.   So  you  can  imagine  the  fireworks  that  would  ensue.   

I  was  the  smartest  person  on  the  team.  I  was  the  worst  person  on  the  team,  but  I   was  the  smartest  person  on  the  team.  It  didn’t  take  me  very  long,  this  was  when  I   was  like  13,  to realize the second  guy has  this  huge advantage because the second   guy is the hitter  and not the hitee. The second guy has a shot at taking the puck  
away.    

What I started  doing was  being a little  slower  than the  other  guy.  And  it  took   about 20  times  of  this  drill for  the other  players  to  realize what I was  doing. They  started  being  slower  than  me.  It  got  up  to Zeno’s  paradox like, “Who would go  slower?”  So  my  dad  said  I  couldn’t  do  that  anymore.   

What I realized  was  there  are  three  things  you need  to  be good  at hockey.    

One  is  it helps  if  you know what to  do.    

The second it  helps if you’re able to do it.    

Third  it’s  really  important  you  care  enough  to  get  hit.   

And  the  journey  that  each  of  you  are  on  is  about  those  three  things.   

Do you  understand from  10,000  feet  what  the  smartest  consultants  and   visionaries in the industry would tell  you is the right  answer?   

Are  you  good  enough  at  writing,  presenting,  organizing,  leading,  hiring,  raising   money,  and  all  those  things  to  actually  do  the  right  thing?   

The third  part  is,  which  were  not  going  to  dwell  on  too  much  this  morning,  do   you care enough about  the project  to get  hit?  Because there is a lot  of that  in what’s  going on.   

When  I  was  starting  out,  I  really  wished  I  could  have  come  to  something  like  this,   which  is  why  I  run  them.   

And  the  problem is  you  can’t  talk  to  your  spouse.  You  can’t  talk  to  your  board  of   directors. You  can’t  talk  to your employees.  You’re  left  alone.  And  here  you  can  talk   to  the  other  folks.    

### Are  You  Ready  To  Do  Something with  the  Duck? 

Ok, the  duck.  The first  thing about  the duck  is there are a  lot  of people who spend  their  time  getting  all  their  ducks  in  a  row.  That  is  not  what  we  are  going  to  spend   our  time  on.   
   

   
   
We’re  going  to  spend  our  time  talking  about  what  you’re  going  to  do  now  that  you  got  a  duck.  That  is  what attracts  me  to  entrepreneurship.   

If  you want to be a neurosurgeon, you spend 15  years  of  your  life getting your   ducks in a  row  and  then  one  day  someone  says,  “Now  you’re a  neurosurgeon.”   

But  if  you’re  an  entrepreneur,  you’re  an  entrepreneur.  Immediately.  There’s  no   permitting  process.  There  are  no  certificates.  You  just  start.   

Along  the  way  you  can  collect  more  ducks  and  get  them in  a  row,  but  the  real  art   of what  we are trying to do here  is  understand  that  you  have  to  do  something  with   the  duck.    

We’re  going to  keep going back again and  again not to  the  lack of  resources,  because  there  are  unlimited  amount  of  resources  available  to  all  you,  not  to  the  lack   of opportunities or connections you  made,  but  the  real  question  on  the  table  is:   

“Are  you  ready  to  do  something  with  the  duck?”   

### Building a  Monopoly 

We’re  going  to  start  by  talking  about  why  the  Monopoly  man  was  on  the  door  when   you  walked  in  and  why  the  Monopoly  man  isn’t  on  the  water  bottles  or  the  coffee   mugs.   

So over  here  I  have  almost  every  Monopoly  iteration  ever  made  including  the   1935  first  edition  of  Monopoly.  The  original  one  doesn’t  seem to  come  with  the   board  and  I’m trying  to  figure  out  how  they  played.  Maybe  it  was  the  depression so  you had  to  draw  your  board  or  something  and  it  was  a  little  picture.  It  was  not  clear.   

We’re  going  to  talk  about  monopoly  for  a  couple  reasons  to  get  us  started.   

The first  reason is there are three ways to think  about  Monopoly and there are  ways  to think about architecture and  how architecture fits  the blank slate you have  to  deal with. So  here  they  are.   

One,  there  is  the  evil  kind  of  AT&T  /  Microsoft  kind  of  monopoly  where  someone   goes and violates whatever  tenants of anti-­‐trust laws  there  are  and unfairly controls  the  market.  We’re  not  talking  about  that  at  all.  There  are  two  other  kinds  of   monopolies.   

The  kind  of  monopoly  we’re  going  to  talk  about  the  most  is  this:  the  reason  you   can’t  put  the  little  man  from Monopoly  on  a  water  bottle  is  Hasbro won’t  let  you.  

Their lawyers are so aggressive that  they have notified every person who prints  coffee  mugs  and  water  bottles.  If  you  send  them the  Monopoly  man,  which  I’ve  tried   to  do, they  will  send  you a note back saying, “We will  not  print  the little Monopoly   man.”   
   


   
   
What  that  means  is  they  have  a  monopoly  on  Monopoly.  If  you  want  Monopoly,   you  have  to  buy  Monopoly  from them.   
Every  successful  business  has  a  monopoly—a  monopoly  on  what  it  makes  that   someone  else  can’t  make  the  way  they  make  it.   

That  leaves  out  commodity  businesses—people who bring coal out of  the  ground.  I  don’t  think  of  those  businesses  as  particularly  successful.  I  think  of  them as   useful.  I’m glad  if  I  need  a  bag  of  coal  someone’s  doing  it,  but  it’s  a  really  lousy  way   to  make  a  living.    

Brilliant entrepreneurship is  around  figuring out that thing you can do  in the   marketplace  that  people  are  willing  to  cross  the  street  to  get.  It’s  so  people   understand, “This  is  the one and  I need  it.”    

And  we’re  going  to  keep  coming  back  again,  again,  and  again today to this  idea of,  “What  is  it  you’re  going  to  have  a  monopoly  on?”   

If  you  know  about  the  company  37  Signals  in  Chicago,  they  are  really  killing   Microsoft  in  a  tiny  segment  of  the  market,  which  is  project  management  on  the  web.   They have a  product  called  Basecamp,  which  cost  $20  bucks  a  month  to  use.  If  four   of  your  colleagues  are  managing  a  project  on  Basecamp  and  you  want to  participate   in the project  you  can’t  shop  around.  They  have  a  monopoly  on  that  project.  You   have to do it  on Basecamp.  And  you  don’t  get  to  say,  “Well  it  cost  too  much  money”   because  they’re  already  using it. So  you have  to  use  it too.    

That  is  a  fundamental  distinction  from the  way  industrialist  thought  in  1930  and   in  1940  when  the  board  game  came  out.  In  those  days  the  thought was, “We’re going  to  figure  out  how  to  make  these  machines  work  just  a  little  better  and  we’re  going  to   figure  out  to  make  this  factory  work  just  a  little  faster,  and  so  we’ll  be  able  to  sell  a   
car just  a little cheaper.”   

The  industrial  mindset,  the one we all  grew  up with, starts with this idea  that   you  have  to  build  a  better  mousetrap  and  make  it  cheaper.   

That’s  not  the  kind  of  entrepreneurship  I’m here  to  propose  to  you  today.  I’m not   talking  about  one  that  is  based  on  the  industrial  economy,  but on the connection  economy.   


And  one  of  the  easiest  ways  to  build  a  monopoly,  a  tiny  profitable  monopoly,  is   to  be  the  center  of  connections. Because  connections  are  so  valuable  to  people   compared  to  stuff.   

>We  went  through  eighty  years  of  stuff  and  now  the   door  is  wide  open  for  people  who want  to make  connection  for  a  living. 


   
   
The  third  reason  we’re  going  to  talk  about  monopoly  is  this:  if  you  have  a  choice   between building a house  on the  blues  or  the  greens, it’s  a tricky  decision because   the  greens  charge  way  more  rent  if  you  land  on  them.  But  the  blues  are  way  cheaper   to  build.  And  these  are  the  decisions  you’re  going  to  make  all  the  time.   

You get to  decide  where  to  build  your  house.    

You get to  decide  if  your  house  has  good  drainage, a good  view, and  is  near  the  ocean.    

You  get  to  decide  how  much  you’re  going  to  spend  on  the  real  estate  where  your   house is.   

And  once  you  do  you’re  locked  into  it.  You  can’t  complain  that  you’re  in  a  lousy   neighborhood. _You  put  it  in  a  lousy neighborhood._   

When  someone  tells  me,  “I’m a  literary  agent,  blah  blah  blah.  The  book  business   is  dying,”  I  say,  “Well  you  don’t  have  to  be  a  literary  agent.  It’s  not  my  fault  the  book   business  is  dying, but if  it is, _move._” Or  if  it’s  not, if  there’s  a lot of  real estate  up for   sale because people are panicking, buy a  bunch of it.    

The virtual  real  estate that’s available in every single industry is a  choice.    You  may  have  15  years  of  experience being in the pizza business, but if  every one  in your town is going gluten free  and  vegan,  it  doesn’t  matter,  it’s  a  sunk  cost.   

### Freelancer of Entrepreneur? 

You’re  going to  decide, “Should  I be  a freelancer  or  an entrepreneur?” Let’s  get that  out  of the way early on because the distinctions between the two are so critical.    

Sarah is  mostly  a  freelancer.  What  that  means  is  people  pay  her  money  and  she   does  work.  If  she  doesn’t  do  work,  people  don’t  pay  her  money.   

Freelancing  is  a  great  way  to  make  a  living.  It’s  what  I  do,  it’s  what  I  use  to  do,   but in-­‐between I was  an entrepreneur.   

Entrepreneurs  build  businesses  bigger  than  themselves.   

Oracle  will be  fine  if  Larry Ellison goes  on his  yacht for  four  weeks. Oracle  is  still  being  Oracle.  People  don’t  use  Oracle  software  because  Larry  Ellison  comes  with  it.   He  makes  money  while  he  sleeps.  He’s  building  something  bigger  than  himself  that   he could sell  one day or take public one day if he chooses.   

When  you  use  the  word  entrepreneur,  you  might  be  mistaking  what  you’re  doing   and  actually you’re  a freelancer.    

This is the reason why the distinction  is  so  important:   
   


   
   
If  you’re  a  freelancer  and  business  is  going  well,  you’re  tempted  to  hire  people  to   do  more  of  the  work.  Because  you  say  to  yourself,  “Wow  this  is  great,  I  get  $200  an   hour  for  this  graphic  design  work.  I’m going  to  hire  someone  for $80 an hour to do  graphic  design  work,  keeping  $120.  And  as  I  add  more  employees  I’m starting  to  act   like  an entrepreneur.”    


This is all  well  and good except  the cheapest  person who you can hire is you. So  when in doubt you hire  yourself. This  is  a problem because  you  just  hired  yourself  to   do the work  and there is no one left  to get  you  new  clients. Now  there is no one left   to  figure  out  the  strategy.  Now  there  is  no  one  left  to  raise  money.  Now  there  is  no   
one left  to build new  offices.    

What  you end up doing is  having a nervous  breakdown  because as  business   slows down  you  do  more  of  the  work.  Instead  of  hiring  someone  for  $80  an  hour,   you hire yourself for $0. Well  great, you’re so busy doing that, just  barely breaking  even, your business can’t  grow  anymore  and  you’re  neither  a  freelancer  nor  an   entrepreneur.   

The first  thing Mark  Zuckerburg has to do if he’s serious about  Facebook  is to  stop  coding. There are people he can hire to code so he doesn’t  have to do it   anymore  so  he  can  go  off  and  do  the  thing only the CEO can do.   

When  you’re  a  bootstrapper,  when  you’re  starting  with  no  money,  of  course   you’re going to hire yourself.    
> The  discipline  of  being an entrepreneur  is  saying,   “How  do  I  make  it so  every  person  that works  for  me  is  better  at their  job  than  I  am?” 


“How  do  I  make  it  so  I  have  no  job  other  than  breaking  the  system?  Because   that’s  my  only  job.”   

Everyone else has  their  job and  when you think of  the world  that way—when  you think  of Howard Schultz and Starbucks, when you open up a Starbucks or  any  coffee  shop,  it’s  mom and  pop.  Mom and  pop  both  work  there  and  it’s  working  really   well,  so  they  open  a  second  one.  Mom is  over  here  in  the  first  coffee  shop  and  pop  is   over here in the second coffee shop. Where you get  into trouble is when you open a   third  coffee  shop because  there  is  no  one  to  run the  third  coffee  shop.   

Howard Schultz got  to Starbucks when  there were five.  Starbucks was in  really  big  trouble  because  they  didn’t  have  a  scalable  model.  They  couldn’t  go  from five  to   fifty because you  couldn’t guarantee that there was  this  cookie cutter, industrial way  to  grow  more  Starbucks.   


What Howard  Schultz  did  that was  brilliant had  nothing to  do  with  his  ability  to   make  coffee.  It  had  to  do  with  his  understanding  that  his  job  as  an  entrepreneur  is  to  build  a  system that  could  scale.  That’s  what  investors  hire  entrepreneurs  to  do—to   scale.    


But  to  be  a  freelancer  or  impresario,  someone  who  does  the  work,  but  doesn’t   build  the  organization  is  totally  great.  I  spend  80%  of  my  time  being  a  freelancer.  If   it  has  my  name  on  it,  I  wrote  it.  I  spend  20%  of  my  time  running  an  internet   company  as  an  entrepreneur,  meaning  not  only  don’t  I  code,  I  don’t  remember  how   to  code,  and  every  time  I  call  one  of  the  seven  people  who  work  at  Squidoo,  I  am  hurting our productivity  because  I  am bothering  someone  who  is  actually  doing  a   good  job  as  I  work  to  break  the  company. 

  
### Q: Break  the  company? 

If  you have three pizza shops  and  they are all working, you have a choice. You  can  just  keep  them working  and  go  to  the  south  of  France  and  they’ll  mail  you  a   $1,000 a week  because you own the business.    

Or  you  can  say,  “For  me  to  get  from 3  to  30,  I’m going  to  have  to  do  something   that  might  not  work.  So  I’m going  to  have  to  take  all  the  money  and  put  it  into   advertising  or  Groupon  coupons  or  I  am going  to  have  to  put  a  new  menu  in  that   breaks  what  was  working  and  maybe  makes  it  better,  but  maybe  doesn’t.”   

And  you  are  the  only  person  who  has  the  authority  to  do  that.  You  don’t  want  the   guy  behind  the  pizza  counter  coming  in  with  a  giant  bag  of  raisins  and  making  raisin   pizza just because it’s  fun.   

As  you’re  structuring  this  business  to  grow,  your  job  is  to  figure  out  where  it   goes.    

### Q: You  can’t  totally leave  the  business  alone.  You  need  to know  that  things  are   working.  Derek  Sivers  wrote  about  how  he  left  things  alone  to such  a  degree  that   the employees  paid  themselves  100%  of  the  profits  amongst  other  things. 


So the thought is you can’t totally leave the business alone. Well the question is,  “Where  is  Thomas  Edison  when  we  need  him?”  He’s  long  gone,  but  GE  persists.   

One  of  the  myths  we  tell  ourselves as an entrepreneur is it  can’t  run without  us.    

Derek’s  only  mistake  was  not  hiring  a  COO  or  President  he  could  trust.  What  he   said  to  the  organization  was,  “Use  your  best  judgment.  I’m not  going  to  look  at  what   you’re  doing.”  And  he  trusted  people  who  weren’t trust worthy.    

What  he  could  have  done,  what  happens  all  the  time,  is  the  founder  says,  “I  have   built a process. The  process  scales.”    

If  you ever  bought Mrs. Fields’ cookies, Mrs. Fields  doesn’t touch the cookie  anymore.  She’s  not  checking  on  anything  anymore.  There  is  a  process  in  place.  This   is the industrialization of your original  idea.   
   
I’m not  saying  that  is  everyone’s  goal.  I  don’t  want  to  do  that.  But  that  is  the   
model  of  classic  entrepreneurship—you build an industrial  thing and it  scales.   


### Q: One  definition  that  I  like  about  a  business  is,  you  could  leave  it  for  a  year  and   when  you  came  back  it  would  be  bigger  and  more  profitable  than  when  you  left.   

Right, because you have this organic thing. You plant a whole bunch of Kudzu,  you  come  back  a year  later  and  it has  grown.    

We’re  going to  talk about lots  of  flavors  of  different businesses. So  I don’t want  you  to  think  this  is  what  I’m saying  _has_ to  happen.  I’m just  describing  these  arcs.
