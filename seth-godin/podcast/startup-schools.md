**A Note from the Editor   
**On  October  1,  2012  Earwolf.com released  the  first  podcast  episode  of  Seth Godin’s  
Startup School  eventually releasing a total of  15  episodes. I enjoyed the Startup  
School podcast  so  much  that  I  transcribed  each  episode.  I  then  lightly  edited  the   
transcriptions  and  finally  designed  this  PDF.    
I hope you  find  this  as  valuable a resource as  I have.

**INTRODUCTION   
**Hey it’s Seth Godin,   
In  the  summer  of  2012  I  had  an  amazing  opportunity  to  spend  three  days  with  a   
group  of  extremely  motivated  entrepreneurs—people right at the beginning of   
building their  project / launching their  organization. During those  three  days  I took  
them on  a  guided  tour  of  some  of  the  questions  they  were  going  to  have  to  wrestle   
with,  some  of  the  difficult  places  they  were  going  through  to  stand  up  and  say,   
**“This  is  me.  This  is  what I’m  making.” **  
I’m sorry  you  couldn’t  be  there,  but  I  hope  this  is  the  next  best  thing.  Excerpts  from  
the  live  event,  unrehearsed,  no  slides.  Here  it  is.  Enjoy  it.  But  even  more  important,  I   
hope  you  do  something  with  it.   
Thanks for listening  reading.

**FREELANCER  OR  ENTREPRENEUR? **  
**An Empty Lot  **  
I want to start by telling you about an architect I just read  about and  sort of  the  
curse  of  the  successful  architect.  This  guy  had  made  a  very  good  living  designing  and   
renovating  houses for rich people.  His kids grew  up,  went  off to college,  and he and  
his  wife  decided  to  move.  That’s  problem number  one.   
Problem number  two  is  they  bought  an  empty  lot.   
So now the architect has to go and build his house. He has to build his house  
without  being  able  to  complain  about  anything  because  it’s  an  empty  lot.   
Most  of  the  time  I  talk  with  people,  who  because  of  circumstances  of  their  job,   
boss, or  wherever  they  are  working, have  all these  other  things  they  have  to  be   
concerned  about.  They  don’t  have  an  empty  lot.  And  each  of  you  has  an  empty  lot.   
That’s  number  one.    
Number  two  is  lots  of  people  have  the  ability  to  get  to  the  point  where  they  could   
invent  the next  thing they’re going to do, but  they find excuses. By  coming  here   
today  you’ve  indicated  you’re  past that.    
So we’re going to spend the first part of this session  assuming  you  are  all  in,   
assuming  we  don’t  have  to  deal  with  the  stuff  that  undermines  our  best  work.   
Then as the days go on and we get  better at  talking to each other and trusting  
each other about  where we are, we’re going to dig to the next  level  of, “If you see it,  
is it  possible you’re going to do it?”   
**Getting Hit **  
I want to start by  telling  a  story  I’ve  only  told  once  before  in  this  room a  couple   
months  ago.   
I grew up in buffalo and  was  really  bad  at ice hockey growing up. In Buffalo there  
is  no  baseball,  there  might  be  bowling,  but  mostly  it’s  ice  hockey.   
When I was  10,  my  parents  sat  me  down.  The  word  “nerd”  wasn’t  in  common   
parlance and  they said, “You can be whatever  that thing is, but you also have to at  
least play  a sport for  a while.”   
My  dad  agreed  to  coach  the  team just  to  make  sure  I  would  actually  do  this.  He   
was  a  great  hockey  coach.  He  had  all  these  drills.  He  came  up  with  all  these   
inventions. Every other coach had two pucks. My  dad  had  thirty  pucks  so  there  was   
never  a shortage.  He drilled  a hole in the pucks  and  they all had  a shoe lacing so  you  
could carry 30  pucks  at once and  stuff  like that.    
   
7   

* * *

   
   
Anyway,  he  invented  this  drill  where  the  puck  is  over  here  and  that’s  the  corner.   
They call  it  the corner, but  it’s sort  of round. One player  would  be here and  one  
player  would  be here. The coach would  throw the puck in the corner  and  this  guy  
would  have  to  skate  and  grab the  puck and  go  this  way  and  this  guy  would  have  to   
go that way. What we were supposed to do is go as fast as you can and  hit the  other   
guy  and  stuff.   So  you  can  imagine  the  fireworks  that  would  ensue.   
I  was  the  smartest  person  on  the  team.  I  was  the  worst  person  on  the  team,  but  I   
was  the  smartest  person  on  the  team.  It  didn’t  take  me  very  long,  this  was  when  I   
was  like  13,  to realize the second  guy has  this  huge advantage because the second   
guy is the hitter  and not the hitee. The second guy has a shot at taking the puck  
away.    
What I started  doing was  being a little  slower  than the  other  guy.  And  it  took   
about 20  times  of  this  drill for  the other  players  to  realize what I was  doing. They  
started  being  slower  than  me.  It  got  up  to Zeno’s  paradox like, “Who would go  
slower?”  So  my  dad  said  I  couldn’t  do  that  anymore.   
What I realized  was  there  are  three  things  you need  to  be good  at hockey.    
One  is  it helps  if  you know what to  do.    
The second it  helps if you’re able to do it.    
Third  it’s  really  important  you  care  enough  to  get  hit.   
And  the  journey  that  each  of  you  are  on  is  about  those  three  things.   
Do you  understand from  10,000  feet  what  the  smartest  consultants  and   
visionaries in the industry would tell  you is the right  answer?   
Are  you  good  enough  at  writing,  presenting,  organizing,  leading,  hiring,  raising   
money,  and  all  those  things  to  actually  do  the  right  thing?   
The third  part  is,  which  were  not  going  to  dwell  on  too  much  this  morning,  do   
you care enough about  the project  to get  hit?  Because there is a lot  of that  in what’s  
going on.   
When  I  was  starting  out,  I  really  wished  I  could  have  come  to  something  like  this,   
which  is  why  I  run  them.   
And  the  problem is  you  can’t  talk  to  your  spouse.  You  can’t  talk  to  your  board  of   
directors. You  can’t  talk  to your employees.  You’re  left  alone.  And  here  you  can  talk   
to  the  other  folks.    
**Are  You  Ready  To  Do  Something with  the  Duck? **  
Ok, the  duck.  The first  thing about  the duck  is there are a  lot  of people who spend  
their  time  getting  all  their  ducks  in  a  row.  That  is  not  what  we  are  going  to  spend   
our  time  on.   
   
8   

* * *

   
   
We’re  going  to  spend  our  time  talking  about  what  you’re  going  to  do  now  that  
you  got  a  duck.  That  is  what  attracts  me  to  entrepreneurship.   
If  you want to be a neurosurgeon, you spend 15  years  of  your  life getting your   
ducks in a  row  and  then  one  day  someone  says,  “Now  you’re a  neurosurgeon.”   
But  if  you’re  an  entrepreneur,  you’re  an  entrepreneur.  Immediately.  There’s  no   
permitting  process.  There  are  no  certificates.  You  just  start.   
Along  the  way  you  can  collect  more  ducks  and  get  them in  a  row,  but  the  real  art   
of what  we are trying to do here  is  understand  that  you  have  to  do  something  with   
the  duck.    
We’re  going to  keep going back again and  again not to  the  lack of  resources,  
because  there  are  unlimited  amount  of  resources  available  to  all  you,  not  to  the  lack   
of opportunities or connections you  made,  but  the  real  question  on  the  table  is:   
“Are  you  ready  to  do  something  with  the  duck?”   
**Building a  Monopoly **  
We’re  going  to  start  by  talking  about  why  the  Monopoly  man  was  on  the  door  when   
you  walked  in  and  why  the  Monopoly  man  isn’t  on  the  water  bottles  or  the  coffee   
mugs.   
So over  here  I  have  almost  every  Monopoly  iteration  ever  made  including  the   
1935  first  edition  of  Monopoly.  The  original  one  doesn’t  seem to  come  with  the   
board  and  I’m trying  to  figure  out  how  they  played.  Maybe  it  was  the  depression so  
you had  to  draw  your  board  or  something  and  it  was  a  little  picture.  It  was  not  clear.   
We’re  going  to  talk  about  monopoly  for  a  couple  reasons  to  get  us  started.   
The first  reason is there are three ways to think  about  Monopoly and there are  
ways  to think about architecture and  how architecture fits  the blank slate you have  
to  deal with. So  here  they  are.   
One,  there  is  the  evil  kind  of  AT&T  /  Microsoft  kind  of  monopoly  where  someone   
goes and violates whatever  tenants of anti-­‐trust laws  there  are  and unfairly controls  
the  market.  We’re  not  talking  about  that  at  all.  There  are  two  other  kinds  of   
monopolies.   
The  kind  of  monopoly  we’re  going  to  talk  about  the  most  is  this:  the  reason  you   
can’t  put  the  little  man  from Monopoly  on  a  water  bottle  is  Hasbro won’t  let  you.  
Their lawyers are so aggressive that  they have notified every person who prints  
coffee  mugs  and  water  bottles.  If  you  send  them the  Monopoly  man,  which  I’ve  tried   
to  do, they  will  send  you a note back saying, “We will  not  print  the little Monopoly   
man.”   
   
9   

* * *

   
   
What  that  means  is  they  have  a  monopoly  on  Monopoly.  If  you  want  Monopoly,   
you  have  to  buy  Monopoly  from them.   
Every  successful  business  has  a  monopoly—a  monopoly  on  what  it  makes  that   
someone  else  can’t  make  the  way  they  make  it.   
That  leaves  out  commodity  businesses—people who bring coal out of  the  
ground.  I  don’t  think  of  those  businesses  as  particularly  successful.  I  think  of  them as   
useful.  I’m glad  if  I  need  a  bag  of  coal  someone’s  doing  it,  but  it’s  a  really  lousy  way   
to  make  a  living.    
Brilliant entrepreneurship is  around  figuring out that thing you can do  in the   
marketplace  that  people  are  willing  to  cross  the  street  to  get.  It’s  so  people   
understand, “This  is  the one and  I need  it.”    
And  we’re  going  to  keep  coming  back  again,  again,  and  again today to this  idea of,  
“What  is  it  you’re  going  to  have  a  monopoly  on?”   
If  you  know  about  the  company  37  Signals  in  Chicago,  they  are  really  killing   
Microsoft  in  a  tiny  segment  of  the  market,  which  is  project  management  on  the  web.   
They have a  product  called  Basecamp,  which  cost  $20  bucks  a  month  to  use.  If  four   
of  your  colleagues  are  managing  a  project  on  Basecamp  and  you  want to  participate   
in the project  you  can’t  shop  around.  They  have  a  monopoly  on  that  project.  You   
have to do it  on Basecamp.  And  you  don’t  get  to  say,  “Well  it  cost  too  much  money”   
because  they’re  already  using it. So  you have  to  use  it too.    
That  is  a  fundamental  distinction  from the  way  industrialist  thought  in  1930  and   
in  1940  when  the  board  game  came  out.  In  those  days  the  thought was, “We’re going  
to  figure  out  how  to  make  these  machines  work  just  a  little  better  and  we’re  going  to   
figure  out  to  make  this  factory  work  just  a  little  faster,  and  so  we’ll  be  able  to  sell  a   
car just  a little cheaper.”   
The  industrial  mindset,  the one we all  grew  up with, starts with this idea  that   
you  have  to  build  a  better  mousetrap  and  make  it  cheaper.   
That’s  not  the  kind  of  entrepreneurship  I’m here  to  propose  to  you  today.  I’m not   
talking  about  one  that  is  based  on  the  industrial  economy,  but on the connection  
economy.   
And  one  of  the  easiest  ways  to  build  a  monopoly,  a  tiny  profitable  monopoly,  is   
to  be  the  center  of  connections. Because  connections  are  so  valuable  to  people   
compared  to  stuff.   
**We  went  through  eighty  years  of  stuff  and  now  the   
door  is  wide  open  for  people  who want  to make **  
**connection  for  a  living. **  
   
10

The  third  reason  we’re  going  to  talk  about  monopoly  is  this:  if  you  have  a  choice   
between building a house  on the  blues  or  the  greens, it’s  a tricky  decision because   
the  greens  charge  way  more  rent  if  you  land  on  them.  But  the  blues  are  way  cheaper   
to  build.  And  these  are  the  decisions  you’re  going  to  make  all  the  time.   
You get to  decide  where  to  build  your  house.    
You get to  decide  if  your  house  has  good  drainage, a good  view, and  is  near  the  
ocean.    
You  get  to  decide  how  much  you’re  going  to  spend  on  the  real  estate  where  your   
house is.   
And  once  you  do  you’re  locked  into  it.  You  can’t  complain  that  you’re  in  a  lousy   
neighborhood. _You  put  it  in  a  lousy neighborhood._   
When  someone  tells  me,  “I’m a  literary  agent,  blah  blah  blah.  The  book  business   
is  dying,”  I  say,  “Well  you  don’t  have  to  be  a  literary  agent.  It’s  not  my  fault  the  book   
business  is  dying, but if  it is, _move._” Or  if  it’s  not, if  there’s  a lot of  real estate  up for   
sale because people are panicking, buy a  bunch of it.    
The virtual  real  estate that’s available in every single industry is a  choice.    
You  may  have  15  years  of  experience being in the pizza business, but if  every one  
in your town is going gluten free  and  vegan,  it  doesn’t  matter,  it’s  a  sunk  cost.   
**Freelancer of Entrepreneur? **  
You’re  going to  decide, “Should  I be  a freelancer  or  an entrepreneur?” Let’s  get that  
out  of the way early on because the distinctions between the two are so critical.    
Sarah is  mostly  a  freelancer.  What  that  means  is  people  pay  her  money  and  she   
does  work.  If  she  doesn’t  do  work,  people  don’t  pay  her  money.   
Freelancing  is  a  great  way  to  make  a  living.  It’s  what  I  do,  it’s  what  I  use  to  do,   
but in-­‐between I was  an entrepreneur.   
Entrepreneurs  build  businesses  bigger  than  themselves.   
Oracle  will be  fine  if  Larry Ellison goes  on his  yacht for  four  weeks. Oracle  is  still  
being  Oracle.  People  don’t  use  Oracle  software  because  Larry  Ellison  comes  with  it.   
He  makes  money  while  he  sleeps.  He’s  building  something  bigger  than  himself  that   
he could sell  one day or take public one day if he chooses.   
When  you  use  the  word  entrepreneur,  you  might  be  mistaking  what  you’re  doing   
and  actually you’re  a freelancer.    
This is the reason why the distinction  is  so  important:

If  you’re  a  freelancer  and  business  is  going  well,  you’re  tempted  to  hire  people  to   
do  more  of  the  work.  Because  you  say  to  yourself,  “Wow  this  is  great,  I  get  $200  an   
hour  for  this  graphic  design  work.  I’m going  to  hire  someone  for $80 an hour to do  
graphic  design  work,  keeping  $120.  And  as  I  add  more  employees  I’m starting  to  act   
like  an entrepreneur.”    
This is all  well  and good except  the cheapest  person who you can hire is you. So  
when in doubt you hire  yourself. This  is  a problem because  you  just  hired  yourself  to   
do the work  and there is no one left  to get  you  new  clients. Now  there is no one left   
to  figure  out  the  strategy.  Now  there  is  no  one  left  to  raise  money.  Now  there  is  no   
one left  to build new  offices.    
What  you end up doing is  having a nervous  breakdown  because as  business   
slows down  you  do  more  of  the  work.  Instead  of  hiring  someone  for  $80  an  hour,   
you hire yourself for $0. Well  great, you’re so busy doing that, just  barely breaking  
even, your business can’t  grow  anymore  and  you’re  neither  a  freelancer  nor  an   
entrepreneur.   
The first  thing Mark  Zuckerburg has to do if he’s serious about  Facebook  is to  
stop  coding. There are people he can hire to code so he doesn’t  have to do it   
anymore  so  he  can  go  off  and  do  the  thing only the CEO can do.   
When  you’re  a  bootstrapper,  when  you’re  starting  with  no  money,  of  course   
you’re going to hire yourself.    
**The  discipline  of  being an entrepreneur  is  saying,   
“How  do  I  make  it so  every  person  that works  for  me **  
**is  better  at their  job  than  I  am?” **  
“How  do  I  make  it  so  I  have  no  job  other  than  breaking  the  system?  Because   
that’s  my  only  job.”   
Everyone else has  their  job and  when you think of  the world  that way—when  
you think  of Howard Schultz and Starbucks, when you open up a Starbucks or  any  
coffee  shop,  it’s  mom and  pop.  Mom and  pop  both  work  there  and  it’s  working  really   
well,  so  they  open  a  second  one.  Mom is  over  here  in  the  first  coffee  shop  and  pop  is   
over here in the second coffee shop. Where you get  into trouble is when you open a   
third  coffee  shop because  there  is  no  one  to  run the  third  coffee  shop.   
Howard Schultz got  to Starbucks when  there were five.  Starbucks was in  really  
big  trouble  because  they  didn’t  have  a  scalable  model.  They  couldn’t  go  from five  to   
fifty because you  couldn’t guarantee that there was  this  cookie cutter, industrial way  
to  grow  more  Starbucks.   
What Howard  Schultz  did  that was  brilliant had  nothing to  do  with  his  ability  to   
make  coffee.  It  had  to  do  with  his  understanding  that  his  job  as  an  entrepreneur  is  to  
   
12

build  a  system that  could  scale.  That’s  what  investors  hire  entrepreneurs  to  do—to   
scale.    
But  to  be  a  freelancer  or  impresario,  someone  who  does  the  work,  but  doesn’t   
build  the  organization  is  totally  great.  I  spend  80%  of  my  time  being  a  freelancer.  If   
it  has  my  name  on  it,  I  wrote  it.  I  spend  20%  of  my  time  running  an  internet   
company  as  an  entrepreneur,  meaning  not  only  don’t  I  code,  I  don’t  remember  how   
to  code,  and  every  time  I  call  one  of  the  seven  people  who  work  at  Squidoo,  I  am  
hurting our productivity  because  I  am bothering  someone  who  is  actually  doing  a   
good  job  as  I  work  to  break  the  company.   
_**Q: Break  the  company? **_  
If  you have three pizza shops  and  they are all working, you have a choice. You  
can  just  keep  them working  and  go  to  the  south  of  France  and  they’ll  mail  you  a   
$1,000 a week  because you own the business.    
Or  you  can  say,  “For  me  to  get  from 3  to  30,  I’m going  to  have  to  do  something   
that  might  not  work.  So  I’m going  to  have  to  take  all  the  money  and  put  it  into   
advertising  or  Groupon  coupons  or  I  am going  to  have  to  put  a  new  menu  in  that   
breaks  what  was  working  and  maybe  makes  it  better,  but  maybe  doesn’t.”   
And  you  are  the  only  person  who  has  the  authority  to  do  that.  You  don’t  want  the   
guy  behind  the  pizza  counter  coming  in  with  a  giant  bag  of  raisins  and  making  raisin   
pizza just because it’s  fun.   
As  you’re  structuring  this  business  to  grow,  your  job  is  to  figure  out  where  it   
goes.    
_**Q: You  can’t  totally leave  the  business  alone.  You  need  to know  that  things  are   
working.  Derek  Sivers  wrote  about  how  he  left  things  alone  to such  a  degree  that   
the employees  paid  themselves  100%  of  the  profits  amongst  other  things. **_  
So the thought is you can’t totally leave the business alone. Well the question is,  
“Where  is  Thomas  Edison  when  we  need  him?”  He’s  long  gone,  but  GE  persists.   
One  of  the  myths  we  tell  ourselves as an entrepreneur is it  can’t  run without  us.    
Derek’s  only  mistake  was  not  hiring  a  COO  or  President  he  could  trust.  What  he   
said  to  the  organization  was,  “Use  your  best  judgment.  I’m not  going  to  look  at  what   
you’re  doing.”  And  he  trusted  people  who  weren’t trust worthy.    
What  he  could  have  done,  what  happens  all  the  time,  is  the  founder  says,  “I  have   
built a process. The  process  scales.”    
If  you ever  bought Mrs. Fields’ cookies, Mrs. Fields  doesn’t touch the cookie  
anymore.  She’s  not  checking  on  anything  anymore.  There  is  a  process  in  place.  This   
is the industrialization of your original  idea.

I’m not  saying  that  is  everyone’s  goal.  I  don’t  want  to  do  that.  But  that  is  the   
model  of  classic  entrepreneurship—you build an industrial  thing and it  scales.   
_**Q: One  definition  that  I  like  about  a  business  is,  you  could  leave  it  for  a  year  and   
when  you  came  back  it  would  be  bigger  and  more  profitable  than  when  you  left. **_  
Right, because you have this organic thing. You plant a whole bunch of Kudzu,  
you  come  back  a year  later  and  it has  grown.    
We’re  going to  talk about lots  of  flavors  of  different businesses. So  I don’t want  
you  to  think  this  is  what  I’m saying  _has_ to  happen.  I’m just  describing  these  arcs.   
**Businesses and  Marketing **  
Let’s talk  about  what  a  business  is  and  what  marketing  is  and  why  they  are   
connected.    
What you do  if  your  running an organization is  you’re  creating value. What that  
means  is  people  are  giving  you  money  because  they  think  what  you’re  doing  is   
worth  more  than  it  costs.   
If  you’re running  a non-­‐profit  and  someone  donates  $100,000  to  the  Acumen   
Fund,  they’re donating  $100,000 because they think  it’s worth $200,000 for the  
privilege of  donating $100,000. If  you realize that’s  what’s  going on, you understand   
that  you  almost  have  an  obligation  to  make  this  available  to  people  because  they’re   
the  ones  who  are  benefiting  from buying  from you.  And  if  they  are  not,  you  need  to   
make  something  better.   
If  someone  wants  you  to  buy  some  old  big  compact  computer  with  a  handle  on  it   
that weighs  1,800  pounds and it’s $500, none of us are going to buy it unless we’re  
some  sorts  of  perverse collector. It’s  not worth $500. If  you’re out there constantly  
bothering  people  and  using  every  marketing  technique  you  can  think  to  push  this  on   
people and  they don’t want  to  buy  it,  something  is  broken  in  the  system that  you’ve   
put together.   
On the  other  hand, when there  is  a line  out the  door  at Grand  Central Station to   
buy  coffee,  something  is  going  on  here.  The  coffee  is  $4.  That’s  expensive,  _if  you  live_  
_in  Duluth_. But if  you’re  in Grand  Central Station and  you need  caffeine, $4  is a   
bargain;  it’s  worth  $6. Basically  there  is  someone  behind  the  counter  handing  out  $2   
bills  all  day  long.  Because  you’re  getting  something  for  $4  that  you’d  be  willing  to   
pay $6  for. How did they do that?   
They  have  a  monopoly  on  a  brand  name.   
They  have  a  monopoly  on  a  story.   
They  have  a  monopoly  on  expectations.   
   
14   

* * *

   
   
And  thanks  to  the  MTA,  they  have  a  monopoly  on  that  actual  piece  of  real  estate.   
There isn’t  a  place right  next  door that  sells  coffee for  $3. If  there were, there’d   
probably  be  more  of  a  line  in  front  of  that  one   
What  they’ve  done  so  brilliantly  is  they’ve  carved  out  attention  and  a  system so   
they  get paid  all day  long giving value  to  people.    
So  what  is  marketing?   
**All  marketing  is  telling  a  story  about  that  value  that   
resonates  with  people enough  that  they want  to  give**  
**you  money.  That’s  it. **  
One  of  things  you need  to  do  as  an entrepreneur  starting out is  figure  out:   
How  do you  tell  the story?   
Who  do  you tell the  story  to?   
How  do you  create this value?   
If  you can do those three things  over  and  over  again, you win.

**ADJUSTING  THE COURSE  **  
The  connection  economy  is  a  bigger  deal  in  terms  of  the  economic  history  of  the   
world  than the  industrial revolution.    
If  we were having this  conference  in 1918, and  I was  sitting here, had  the  guy  
from Scientific  Tale  or  Scientific  Management  over  here,  Henry  Ford  talking  about   
mass  production  over  there,  and  I  was  describing  how  you  could  use  the  techniques   
of  mass  production,  mass  marketing,  and  industrialization  to  make  a  business,  it   
would  seem just  as  hard.  There  were  2,300  car  companies  in  1918.  And  so  there  is   
all this  stuff  that is  going on.   
I’m not  promising  you’re  going  to  build  a  business  that  is  going  to  make  one   
million  dollars in a  year. I think  that’s unlikely.  What  I  am promising  is  you can have  
a  business  plan  that  lets  you  see  a  path  to  probably  succeeding  more  than  not.   
**The  hart  part  isn’t  going  to  be  defining  the  path. **  
**The  hard part  is  going  to  be  doing  the  scary  thing  to **  
**stick  to  the  path. **  
The reason everyone doesn’t  do this is because it’s really frightening and you get   
very  little  support  from the  people  around  you  to  do  this  very  difficult  scary  work  of   
putting yourself  out  there  and  saying,  “Hi  this  is  me,  I  made  this.”   
If  you  make  it  and  people  don’t  see  the  value,  you  don’t  give  up,  you  remake  it.   
Zig  Ziglar,  one  of  my  heroes,  tells  this  story  of  a  plane  taking  off  from New  York   
headed  to  Dallas.  Five  minutes  into the flight  it’s windy so they’re off course. The  
plane doesn’t turn around  in New York and  start over. It just adjusts  its  course and   
keeps  adjusting its  course  until it gets  to  Dallas.   
If  you’re  going  to  buy  into  the  life  of  making  it  either  as  a  bootstrapped  or  funded   
entrepreneur or a  freelancer, you’re going to have all  these things that  don’t  work.    
I  got  900  rejection  letters  in  a  row  my  first  year  in  the  book  business.  I  didn’t  sell   
one  thing.  You  just  adjust  and  you  learn  from it.   
The  number  of  places  we need  you—the  number  of  places  you can add  value—is  
so huge that  it’s a  pretty safe bet  that  along the way you’re going to get  to Dallas.   
_**Q: Are  you  saying  that  we  should  make  a  decision  as  soon  as  possible  whether   
we  are  entrepreneurs  or  freelancers?  **_  
Yes,  by  tomorrow  for  sure.  This  is  the  biggest  source  of  unhappiness  for  people   
who  start their  own business. They’re  not being clear  on the  difference  and  not  
willing  to  commit  to  one  or  the  other.

_**Q: I  am  slightly confused  as  to what  consulting  is  because  it  seems  like  that’s  the   
misstep  of  freelancing  and  entrepreneurship,  running  around  in  circles, **_  
_**pretending  some  sort  of  product  leaves  the  office. **_  
When  you  say  consulting,  do  you  mean  like  what  McKinsey  does  consulting?   
Bane  and  getting hired  for  $300  an  hour  to  tell  someone  how  to  do  a  better  job?   
Consultants are always freelancers.  There are a  few  who pretend they are  
entrepreneurs  because  they  built  some  proprietary  database:  Arthur  Anderson  with   
their  2,000  people  on the  street.    
What will happen  is  Coca  Cola  will  decide  they  want  to  switch  from a  matrix   
organization  to  a  direct  reports  organization.  They  have  25,000  employees.  “What   
should  we  do?”  They  hire  Arthur  Anderson.  Arthur  Anderson  sends  100  recent   
college grads that  parachute in. They do all  these interviews. They’re consultants.    
The thing is the  return  on  equity  at  Arthur  Anderson  is  pretty  low.  They  only   
grow  by  being  basically  a  temporary  employment  agency  marking  up  the  people   
who  work  for  them.   
Real entrepreneurship again is, if the geniuses who work  there took  two weeks  
off,  would  the  business  keep  running?  No,  because  the  people  who  hire  Arthur   
Anderson  are  paying  for  the  genius  to  come  in  and  see  them and  they  are  paying  by   
the  hour.    
If  you are a consultant, the easy hard  part  is,  “Are  you  smart  enough  to  give  good   
advice?”    
The _hard_  _hard_  part  is,  “Do  people  trust  you  enough  to  pay  you  to  give  them good   
advice?”   
So what happens if you work for  McKinsey is you go to Harvard graduate school  
and  you go  to  McKinsey. McKinsey bills you  out  at  $900-­‐$1,200 an hour. You  say,  
“Wow,  that’s  amazing  because I work  2,000 hours a year;  2,000  times  1,000, that’s  
$2  million.  I’m going  to  quit  and  go  be  me,  same  advice,  without  the  McKinsey   
name.”   
And  what  those  people  discover  every  time  is  they can’t  charge $1,000 an hour  
anymore.  Because  what  you’re  buying  when  you  buy  McKinsey  is  the  fact  that  you   
can go to your board of directors and say, “I want  to close the plant  in Georgia.  
McKinsey  said  it was  a good  idea.”    
People believing the advice  is  good  are what consultants  usually sell.    
There  is  a  second  model  though,  which  says,  “I’ll  give  you  advice  and  if  it  works,   
then  you  pay  me.”  “I’ll  give  you  advice  and  I’m a  stock  broker  and  I  hedge  fund,  and   
I’m going  to  keep  part  of  the  profit.”  That  starts  to  shift  and  now  your  not  so  much  a   
consultant  as  you  are  a  risk  partner  with  somebody  else.  And  that  can  truly  scale  in   
terms  of  what  you’re  doing.   
   
17   

* * *

   
   
Scaling  back  to  what  we  heard  a  little  bit  earlier,  we’re  going  to  keep  coming   
back again and  again  to  what  kind  of  dent  are  your  trying  to  make  in  the  universe?   
Are  you  trying  to  make  the  dent  in  the  universe  that  you  make  a  decent  living   
doing what  you  love?  _Or… _  
Are  you  trying  to  make  a  dent  in  the  universe  by  saying,  “There  are  now  non-­‐  
profits  in  my  town  that  are  extremely  well  funded  because  I  made  a  disruption  in   
the  universe  to  make  that  happen.”   
There is no right  answer to this. But  you have to be honest  with yourself about   
how  big  a  ruckus  you  are  trying  to  make  and  why  you  are  making  that  ruckus.    
When its not  working and when it’s  hard,  you’re  going  to  keep  coming  back  to:   
“Why  am I  doing  this  again?”  And  if  there  is  a  mismatch,  you’re  going  to  flee.   
Here’s  what  we  have  to  understand.  And  we  made  it  a  whole  hour  before  I   
brought up the  Lizard  Brain.   
You  can  be  the  smartest,  best  educated  business  person  in  the  world,  but  if  the   
voice in the back  of your head helps push you to avoid opportunities, its not  going to  
do you  any good.    
As  we  go  through  these  questions,  you’re  going  to  hear  a  question  and  part of   
you is going to know  the right  answer and part  of you is going to say, “Ehhhh, I want   
to  do  this  answer.”   
I need  to highlight for  you when that is  happening. You need  to be really clear   
with  yourself  about why  you’re  avoiding it.    
**A  $40  Billion Dollar  T-­Shirt **  
It’s  1998,  the  Internet  bubble  is  really  starting  to  get  rolling.  Why  do  some  people  go   
and  start  an  Internet  company  and  why  do  some  people  who  know  just  as  much   
don’t?   
It’s  not  about  the  external  information,  it’s  about  what  are  you  telling yourself,  
and  what are  you afraid  of.   
My  story  on this  is  I have  a t-­‐shirt  that  was worth about  forty billion dollars.   
  In the ‘80s  I did  a job called  book packaging. What book packagers  do is  we  
think of  an idea for  a book and  we  sell it to  a publisher. If they like it  we have to  
make  it.  It’s  like  being  a  movie  producer,  but  for  books.   
I did  120  books—10  books  a  year,  for  12  years.  I  sold  millions  of  copies.  Some   
you  may  have  heard  of,  some  bestsellers,  and  a  lot  of  books  you  never  heard  of:   
books  on  spot  and  stain  removal,  books  on  gardening,  a  lot  of  business  books.  Some   
have  my  name,  some  don’t.   
   
18   

* * *

   
   
I  also  knew  a  bunch  about  the  Internet  because  my  background  was  working  at   
Prodigy,  a  computer  software  company.  Being  a  freelancer,  magazines  were  calling  
me  up  to  write  articles  about  the  Internet.  To  make  ends  meet, I would stop being  
CEO  of  this  company  with  10  employees  and  hire  myself  to  write  a  magazine  article   
for $2,000.   
I wrote one of  the very first cover  stories  about what this  web thing was. Here it   
is 1992 and I have a  high-­‐speed  connection  to  the  Internet.  I’m writing  articles  about   
what is  on the  Internet and  seeing it start I say, “What should  I do?”   
I say, “I know, I’ll write a book called  Best of  the Net.”    
Everything  I  had  was  a  hammer  and  that  looked  like  a  nail.  I  sold  it  to  a  book   
publisher  for  $80,000.    
I hired  three people and  we worked  for  a year  to put together  this  big thick book  
of 250 cool  things you could find on the Internet. There was no World Wide Web  yet.   
This was the Internet. This was before the World Wide Web. So with all  of this  
stuff going on, I  wrote a  book  for $80,000.    
And  on  the  T-­‐shirt  was  this  guy  on  the  front  that  we  made  for  the  sales  force.  On   
the  front it said, “Best of  the  Net” and on the back it said, “World Wide Internet  
Surfing  Team.”  I  gave  a  copy  of  the  book  to  every  single  person  on  the  sales  force  so   
they  would  sell a lot.   
The book  didn’t  sell.   
At  exactly  the  same  time  with  less  money  than  I  had,  two  guys  at  Stanford, David   
and  Jerry,  started  something  called  Yahoo.   
**They  saw  the  Internet  and built  a  search  engine.  I  saw **  
**the  Internet and  wrote  a  200-­page  book. **  
Their  company  at  one  point  was  worth  $80  billion  dollars  so  I  figure  I  would   
have  had  half  of  it.  So  my  t-­‐shirt  is a forty billion dollar  t-­‐shirt.  And  I  keep  it  right  by   
my  desk  because  it’s  really  obvious  to  me  why  I  didn’t  start  a  search  engine  because   
I’m not  the  kind  of  guy  who  starts  a  search  engine.   
I’m the  kind  of  guy  who  writes  a  book  about  what’s  on  the  Internet and that’s  
why  today  is  such  an interesting day. Because  you guys  all just bought an acre  of   
beachfront property  and  you can build  whatever  kind  of  house  you want on it and  if   
you want  to build a book, go ahead, but  don’t  whine later that  it’s worth $80 billion  
dollars and you  don’t  own any of it.    
That  fork  in  the  road  ought  to  become  clear  as  we  go  through  these  questions.

Question #1  about your  business—and what I want you to do as I go through these  
questions is to feel  free writing them  down  or  just  think  hard  about  them.  But  I  think   
in  this  case  writing  something  down  will  force  you  to  be  a  little  more  honest.   
_**Question  #1: Who is  it  for? **_  
Nothing  is  for  everyone.  Nothing.  The  vast  majority  of  people  in  the  world  have   
never  had a cup of  Starbucks  coffee.    
The  vast  majority  of people who have a  phone never  used an iPhone.    
The  vast  majority  of  people  in  India  do  not  have  indoor  plumbing.   
Nothing you  brought  here is for everyone. If you  think  it’s for everyone, you  have  
to  start over.   
_**Question  #2: this  group  that  it’s  for,  has  subgroups  in  it.  And  what  I  want  to   
know  about  any given  subgroup  (you  can  start  with  a  big  one)  is  what  do they**_  
_**believe? **_  
Let  me  give  you  a  very  specific  example  of  what  I  am talking  about  when  I  talk   
about worldview.   
Lots  of  people  who  live  in  this  part  of  the  world  wake  up  in  the  morning  and  say,   
“What  a  beautiful  day,  I’m going  to  go  to  the  store  and  buy  something”  and  they   
don’t  know  what  they are going to buy before they go to the store. We call  this  
shopping. They’re looking forward to going shopping and they believe, they would  
never  use these exact words, that shopping is an enjoyable activity—that going to   
the  store  isn’t stressful, it’s  fun.    
There  are  other  people  in  the  world,  more  of  them,  who  have  never once in their  
life  bought  something  their  family  has  never  bought  before.  Never  once.  And  if  they   
have  to  buy  something  it’s  one  of  the  most  stressful  things  in  their  life  because  it’s  a   
matter  of  life  or  death.  If  you  make  $3  a  day  and  you  have  to  go  buy  something,   
maybe  a  pair  of  glasses,  and  you’re  wrong  and  the  $3,  $4,  or  $5  you  spend  is  wasted,   
your  kid  might  die.  So  that  person’s  worldview  is  not,  “Let’s  go  shopping!”  That   
person’s  worldview  is,  “Please,  please,  please,  lets  make  sure  everything  is  the  
same.”   
When  we  think  of  worldviews  of  smaller  groups,  there  is  a  group  of  people  who   
in  three  weeks  when  Apple  launches  its  new  product  will  buy  it  that  day  because  it   
makes  them happy.   
There is a  different  group of people that  will  buy it  four weeks  later  because  
waiting  four  weeks  makes  them feel  smart.   
And  there  is  a  different  group  of  people  that  will  wait  at  least  six  months  before   
they  buy  it  because  they  are  smarter  than  the  other  two  groups  of  people.

These are stories we tell  ourselves.    
In 12 weeks there are going to be presidential  debates. Two people will  watch  
the  debates  and  one  of  them will  have  exactly  the  wrong  impression  of  what  just   
happened. The other person is sure they heard the right  thing, but  the second  
person  heard  something  completely  different.  Not  because  of  what  was  on  TV,  but   
because  of  the  stories  we  tell ourselves.    
If  you think about the product or service you  are offering and the group  or  
subgroup  you  are  offering  it  to,  what’s  the  story  they  are  telling  themselves?   
If  we  look  at  Chris’  shoes,  he  is  wearing  hand  made  sneakers  for  barefoot   
runners.  _\[How  many of  you  have ever  heard  of  barefoot  running,  raise your  hand.  How _  
_many of  you  have ever  done barefoot  running?  How  many of  you  keep  doing  barefoot   
running.  So  we’re  down  to  one.\]_   
It’s  not that barefoot running is  better  or  worse for  everyone here—we  can have   
that  conversation.  It’s  interesting  that  Yoni  is  the  kind  of  person  who  tells  himself   
the  story  about a new technology  of  working out. Chris  is  the  kind  of  person who  
likes  wearing  something  that  says  something  about  him while  he’s  wearing  it  on  his   
feet.  And  most  of  us  are  old  enough  where  we’re  like,  “Uh.  I  can’t  learn  a  new  way  to   
run.  That’s  like  completely  outside  my  comfort  zone.”   
These are worldviews. They are  not right or  not wrong. They’re  just true. So, we   
have to be very clear when we talk  to each other about, “Who is this for?”   
Christina  sells  web  design,  html,  graphics,  architecture  underneath,  apps,  and   
things. If  she  is  trying to  get a new client, sometimes  she  can  call  on  someone  and   
they’re  eager  to  hear  from the  new  sparkly  cutting  edge  designer.  “Come  on  in,  let’s   
start  white boarding it.”   
And  other  people  she  calls  on,  their  arms  are  folded.  She  represents  a  threat  at   
seven different  levels. You can beat yourself  up that you did  a bad  job at the second   
meeting  or  you  can  realize  it’s  not  for  them and  go  call  on  someone  who  it  is  for.   
_**Question  #3,  this  group  that  we’re  imagining,  or  this  subgroup,  have  they ever   
spent  cash  money to buy something  like  this  before? **_  
If  you’re  trying  to  sell  to  virgins,  it’s  a  lot  more  difficult  than  it  is  to  go  to   
someone  who  regularly  buys.   
A  simple  example  is  someone  who  sells  mattresses  for  a  living.   
There are two kinds of people in the world. People who only buy  a  mattress   
when  they  have  no  choice  and  people  who  buy  a  mattress  because  they  think  it will  
help  them sleep  better.  They  buy  mattresses  five  to  ten  times  in  their  lives.   
   
21   

* * *

   
   
If  it’s  the  second  kind  of  person,  selling  them a  mattress  is  much,  much  easier   
than  selling  a  mattress  to  someone  who  thinks  they  should  never  have  to  buy  a   
mattress.   
I need  to clarify two things.   
One, there  are  three  different kinds  of  revenue  I am  talking about:  the revenue of  
cash, the revenue of attention and trust, and the revenue of referral.    
There are lots of businesses that  need the revenue of attention and trust, like  
“I’m going  to  watch  channel  4  tonight.”  You’re  not  paying  them in  cash,  but  you’re   
giving  them attention  and  trust  which  they  can  figure  out  how  to  make  money.   
There  are  different  flavors  of  that  and  we’re  going  to  go  deeper  into  all  of  them  
as  we  go  into  this. Different ways  of  people  paying.    
_**Question  #4: does  this  group,  this  core  group,  this  group  we  know  their   
worldview,  the  group  we  know  it’s  for—do they know  about  you?  Do they know **_  
_**you  exist? **_  
There  is  a  huge  gulf  from selling  to  people  who  know  about  you  and  selling  to   
people who have never  heard  of  you.    
_**These  people  who are  aware  of  you,  do they trust  you? **_  
Now  this is huge. So Yoni lives in Toronto and is  able  to  bump  into  a  fair  number   
of  wealthy  or  semi-­‐wealthy  Canadians  and  he  knows  people  who  can  introduce  him  
to  wealthy  or  semi-­‐wealthy  Canadians.  Getting  himself  to  be  heard  of  is  not   
impossible.  You  can  cold  call  people.  You  can  send  them letters  in  the  mail.  You  can   
have a  cocktail  party. But  do they trust  you?   
Is  that group of  people then going to pick up the phone of  their  own volition and   
say,  “I’m changing  my  will,  can  we  have  a  meeting  so  I  can  hire  you  to  figure  out  how   
to  solve  this  problem.”   
There’s  this  big  gap  between  someone  being  aware  of  you,  which  is  really  hard,   
and  then  someone  trusting  you  enough  to  invest  you  or  buy  from you.   
If  you  go  to  Christina’s  website  and  you  dig  in,  there’s  some  real  chops  there.  She   
and  her  husband  make  interesting good software. But  she only has three seconds on  
the  website  to  persuade  us  of  that if  we’re  strangers.    
On the  other  hand, if  I  meet  her  at  a  conference,  see  her  do  a  demo,  and  she’s  up  
on  the  stage  getting  a  big  ovation  at  the  end  and  my  boss  comes  to  me  the  next  day   
and  says,  “What  are  we  going  to  do  Seth,  we  need  blah  blah  blah.”  I’m going  to   
remember  I  met  Christina.  I  don’t  need  her  website  at  this  point  because  I  already   
trust her  for  a different reason.

As  I  keep  talking  to  you  about  your  businesses, we’re going to keep  taking this  
apart. How did  a stranger  know to  do  business  with  you and  did  they trust you?   
Keep writing this  down and  I’ll put you on the  spot as  we  go.   
_**These  people  that  are  paying,  are  they paying  with  money or  trust/attention  or   
referral? Are  they paying  with  their  own  money  because  they are  a  consumer  or **_  
_**are  they paying  with  their  boss’s  money because  they are  a  business? **_  
How  many  of  you  would  like  to  sell  to  businesses  as  opposed  to  consumers?  Ok,   
about a third, that’s  usual.    
I  always  use  consumer  examples,  because  we  all  are  consumers,  but  I  believe   
they  are  the  same.  I  think  a  business  purchase  is  the  same  as  a  consumer  purchase   
except,  this  is  the  big  except:  one,  they’re  using  someone  else’s  money  and  two,   
they’re  not tying  to  please  themselves,  they’re  trying  to  please  their  boss.   
**The  question  the  business  purchaser  asks  is  not,  “Will   
this  improve  my  profitability?” They  only  ask  that if  
they  are  the  president.  They ask,  “Will this  make  my **  
**boss  happy?” **  
So Terry and Kate  used  to  work  for  ICM,  which  is  a  fairly  famous  agency—  
literary,  movies, etc. Why does an author, screenwriter,  or  someone  else  hire  ICM  to   
represent  themselves  instead  of  just  some  guys  with  a  food  cart?   
Part  of the reason is they believe that  when it’s  a  meeting  at  Warner  Brothers,   
the  person  being  sold  to  will  be  more  likely  to  spend  money  because  he  can  tell  his   
boss  he  bought  it  from ICM  or  he  bought  it  from Vicki  Irvin  or  Stuart  Krichevsky  as   
opposed  to,  “I  bought  it  from Cheryl,  you  never  heard  of  her.”  That  _story_  they tell  
their  boss  when  they’re  buying  something  from you  is  actually  what  they’re  buying.   
Is  this  starting to fit into place?   
**Business Models  and  Impresarios  **  
Now  we’re  going  to  step  sideways.  In  the  connection  economy,  we  have  to  think  
about  the  value  your  business  creates,  and  there  are  a  lot  of  business  models.   
_\[There  is  a  book  that  goes  into  extraordinary detail  about  how  business  models  are_  
_constructed.  The book’s  called  Business  Model  Generation  and  they did  a  really  
thoughtful  job on  it.  There’s  also  an  iPad  app.\] _  
The  industrial  model  of  value  creation  is:  Here.  It’s  a widget. You should  buy  it  
from me.  This  widget  is  the  Logitec  USB  remote  and  it’s  $29.   
   
23   

* * *

   
   
If  it’s  worth $30  to you, you should  buy it because it’s  only $29  and  that’s  it.  
That’s  the  interaction.  A company  made  a  product,  offered  it  to  you,  probably  with a   
middleman  like  Amazon,  Wallmart,  or  whatever,  you  bought  it,  end  of  discussion.   
There  are  many  new  businesses  though  in  the  connection  economy  that  exists  to   
connect  one  person  to  another  person.  That’s  a  fundamentally  different  thing.   
If  you go to use  Facebook,  you’re  using  it  not  because  you  want  to  hear  from  
Mark  Zuckerberg,  not  because  you  want  to  hear  from their  advertisers;  that’s  a  tax   
you pay. You’re using it  so Chris and Sarah can connect. One person to another.    
And  we’re  going  to  talk  a  little  bit  about  this  idea  of  impresarios—what it is  to   
put on a show and  create a place or  venue where people can interact. What we see  
over  and  over  again  is  those  are  extremely  powerful,  seductive, profitable  
businesses  because  that’s  what’s  missing.   
**People  are  lonely. **  
People are lonely in business settings and they are lonely in personal  settings.   
If  you  run  a  trade  show  for  the  right  people,  they’re  not  coming  to  hear  from you.   
They’re  coming  to  hear  from each  other  and  building  those  connections  becomes  
really powerful.   
Or  are  you  connecting  one  customer  to  what  you  make?   
Or  are  you  trying  to  connect  one  kind  of  customer  to  another  kind  of  customer?   
This is Google.   
Google  says,  if  you  are  a  person,  a  human  being,  come  here  to  find  stuff  on  the   
Internet.  And  they  if  you  are  an  advertiser,  if  you  want  to  reach  human  beings,  come   
here  to  reach  human  beings.  And  both  sides  are  happy  with  the  deal.   
Lots of people go to Google and click  on the ads and lots of people run ads on  
Google  so  people  will  click  on  them.  What  Google  has  created  is  a  bridge  between   
one  kind  of  customer,  the  surfer,  and  the  other  kind  of  customer,  the  kind  that  wants   
to  be  surfed.    
One  could  imagine  being a broker  between philanthropists  and charities. You   
could say to philanthropists,  “I’m only  going  to  represent  a  dozen  of  you.  You  need   
someone  you  trust  to  be  a  middleman.  I’m going  to  take  care  of  the  12  of  you.  You   
will  get  to  meet  each  other  and  I  will  hand  pick  the  charities  who  want  to  come  meet   
you.”   
Then, by connecting the two, you create value. Because charities need  
philanthropists  and  philanthropists  need  charities.

**CREATING SCARCITY  **  
**Hiring a  Solution **  
If  someone  is  going  to  do  business  with you, they’re hiring your  product to solve a  
problem—Just  like  they  hire  somebody  to  fix  their  back  or  work  for  them.   
Clay  \[Shirky\]  tells  the  story  of  he  got  hired  by  McDonalds  to  make  milkshake   
sales  go  up.  He  did  some  research  and  discovered  that  30%  of  all  milkshake  sales   
are  at  breakfast.  It  turns  out  customers  were  hiring  the  milkshake  to  solve  their   
problem which  is,  “How  do  I  eat  something  for  breakfast  while  driving  that  I  can  eat   
with  a straw?”   
And  if  you  could  solve  that  problem you  could  get  hired  to  do  it.  The  milkshake   
was  the  best  solution  for  sale.  So  McDonalds  apparently  made  up  so  new  kind  of   
breakfast thing that people  perceived  as  being healthier  for  breakfast.    
**The  point  is,  when  you tell  me  your  business,  what   
I’m  really  saying  is,  “Would  I  hire  that  product  or **  
**service  to  solve  my  problem?” **  
I  am not  saying,  “Do  I  like  it  or  do  I  like  Don?”  That’s  way  down  the  list.  What’s  on   
the  list  is,  “I  heard  your  story.  I  trust  you  enough.  I’m going  to  listen  to  your  story.   
Now  that  I’ve heard  your  story  and  I  trust  it,  do  I  want  to  hire  that  story  to  solve  my   
problem?”   
If  you think about all the brands, events  and  stuff  we buy, that’s  why we bought  
it,  to  solve  a  problem.  And  so  I’m going  to  ask  you  what  am I  hiring  you  to  do?  And  if   
your product  solves  that  problem,  I’m much  more  likely  to  hire  you  to  do  it.   
  What  it’s  probably  going  to  be  is,  “To  impress  my  boss;  to  impress  my  family;  to   
connect  with  people  because  I’m lonely;  to  figure  out  how  to  feel  less  afraid.”  These   
are  the  reasons  we  do stuff. Not  because we have six  widgets and we want  seven.    
**The  Placebo  Effect  and  Telling Stories **  
_**Q: How  do you  say that  you’re  offering  a  product  that  will  solve  the  problem  of   
lack  of  confidence,  but  you  have  to sell  something  else?  Like  for  example,  I’m  a **_  
_**presentation  coach,  I  want  to be  super  honest  to them  and  say to them  I’m   
selling  them  time  and  confidence  because  most  people  just  need  to be  sure  that   
they won’t  make  fools  of  themselves.  But  I  can’t  tell  them  I’m  selling  them **_  
_**confidence.  So I  don’t  know  how  to be  like,  “what  I’m  selling  is  great   
presentations,”  when I really care  about  that  the  least. **_  
Right.  And  this  is  why  “All  Marketers  Are  Liars”  is  a  bad  title  for  a  book.  Because   
there  are  very  few  professions,  some  very  old,  where  people  were  extremely  honest   
   
25

about  what  you  were  buying.  But  in  general,  that’s  not  the  way  human  beings  want   
to  be  marketed  to.   
Human  beings  when  they  buy  a  $90  bottle  of  wine,  we  have  real  clear  data  on   
this, think it tastes  better  than a $10  bottle  of  wine  even though  we  could  switch  the   
wines. When I go  to  the  person at the  table  I don’t say, “Would  you like  the   
expensive wine because  the  placebo  effect  will  cause  you  to  enjoy  it  more?”   
I have to put on the wine show in order  for  the placebo effect to work.    
You  have  to  make  your  own  ethical  decision  about  whether  the  ends  and  the   
means  are  justified.   
The fact  is, there is no non-­‐fiction book  published that  could not be written in  
five pages. Right?  “Here is the five  page  summary  of  what  is  in  this  book.  You  don’t   
have to read it.”  So why do we want  to read it?  We want  to read it  because the act  of  
reading  it  or just  holding  it  makes  us  feel  different  than  the  information.   
The  act  of  going  to  Bumble  and  Bumble  for  a  haircut  may  end  up  with  exactly  the   
same  hair  as  the  $30  haircut  four  blocks  away,  but  it  makes  us  feel  prettier.  So  we   
are  prettier  because  we  walk differently down  the street.   
You’re  not  going  to  be  able  to  just  walk  up  to  people,  tell  them the  actual  digital   
truth  of  why  you were  there  and  expect the  placebo  effect to  work. It won’t. That’s   
the  magic  of  the  placebo  effect.   
The challenge here and  the  way I’ve  dealt  with it anyway is  to say,   
**The  difference  between manipulation and  marketing  
is  manipulation  is  I  get you  to  buy  something  you   
regret  later.  And  marketing is  I  get  you  to  buy**  
**something  you’re  glad  you  bought. **  
Your  opportunity is  to  tell a story about why somebody  should  hire  you  as  a   
presentation  coach  that  gets  them to  become  confident.  Because  if  they  become   
confident,  they’re  going  to  be  happy  recommending  you  to  the  next  person  and   
you’ve achieved your goal.    
The art  of this is, we’re going to practice, practice, and practice, can you tell that  
story,  not  to  me,  but  to  the  person  who  needs  to  hear  it  in  a  way  that  resonates  with   
them?  There  are  so  many  examples  of  this.   
How  many  of  you  have  ever  been  to  a  chiropractor?  Why  doesn’t  the   
chiropractor  make  you take off  your  shirt?    
If  they  made  you  take  off  your  shirt,  were  wearing  a  white  smock,  and  their   
hands  touched  your  skin,  you  would  get  better  faster  than  you  walking  in  and  them  
saying, “Don’t  bother taking off your suit  jacket  or tuxedo, it  doesn’t  matter  I’m just

going  to…and  you  can  leave.”  That’s  showing  off,  but  it’s  not  touching  human  beings   
in  a  way  that  we  know  makes  human  beings  feel  better.   
And  medical  practitioners  screw  this  up  all  the  time.  I’m not  picking  on   
chiropractors.  All  sorts  of  medical  practices  would  work  better  if  the  act  would  be   
more  like  sommeliers  and  added  more  placebo  effect  stuff.  If  the  goal  is  to  make   
people healthier, then that’s  what they should  do. Make people healthier  and  don’t  
worry  about the  nuts  and  bolts  level  of  what’s  happening  at  the  molecular  stage.   
**The Lock-­In Effect **  
If  the  thing  you’re  doing  catches  on,  what’s  to  keep  somebody  else  doing  exactly   
what  you  do  for  half  price  and  everyone  will  move?  There  are  a  lot  of  answers  to  this   
question.    
For  example,  there are plenty of  search engines  that give search results  just as   
good  as  Google,  but  with  more  results  per  page,  better  privacy,  less  annoying  ads,   
whatever  it is  and  everyone  hasn’t switched. In fact,  almost  no  one  has  switched   
because the lock  in effect  it  very powerful.    
There  are  people  who  always  go  to  the  same  provider  when  they  need  a   
freelance copywriter.   
_**Q: Why didn’t  they switch  off  of  Google? **_  
Lock  in  effect.  What  lock-­‐in  says  is  it’s  just  too  hard  for  me  to  switch.  It  might  be   
hard  economically, organizationally, and  technologically.    
Once  Apple  has  persuaded  an  elementary  school  to  go  Mac  and  then  Dell  shows   
up  with  a  cheaper  one,  even  though  they’re  going  to  be  replacing  their  computers,   
they  don’t switch  because  all their  software  isn’t going to work. The lock-­‐in effect  is  
because  the  software  goes  with  the  hardware, so  you’re  not going to  switch  the   
hardware.    
But the  lock-­‐in  effect  more  often  is  emotional.  You  have  to  admit  to  yourself  or   
your peers that  you were wrong and now  you’re going  to  switch  to  something  that’s   
better.  Some  people  are  immune  to  lock-­‐in  and  switch  all  the  time,  but  lots  and  lots   
of people get  locked into  a solution. The  question is  how  do you do that?   
Why  does  Starbucks  spend  so  much  effort  marketing  the  Starbucks  card?   
Because  there’s  no  more  money  in  it  for  them.  The  answer  is,  if  you’re  in  an  airport   
and  there  is  a Starbucks  partender, you got your  Starbucks  card, “I’ll just go  there.  
It’s  easier.” It builds  up lock-­‐in.    
American  Airlines  invented  frequent  flier  miles  because  it  made  a  huge   
difference for lock-­‐in.  Not  because  the  person  who  flies  the  most  needs  the  miles.   
They  don’t.  But  emotionally  they  felt  they  were  sabotaging  themselves  by  not  adding   
to  some  number  even  though  they’re  never  going  to  trade  their  miles  for  anything  of   
value.

We’re going  to  keep  coming  back  again  to  this is going to be really hard for you  
to  make  it  work.  It’s  going  to  be  really  hard  for  you  to  get  started,  but  are  you   
building this  house  on this  land, in the  structure  the  way  you want, in the  way you’re   
going to be glad you did or  is it a one-­‐trick pony  and  then you’re  going to  go  to  the   
next thing?   
If  I  look  at  Angry  Birds,  Angry  Birds  is  a  huge  hit.  If  all  they  wanted  to  do  was   
make  a  hit  and  retire,  it  was  perfect.   
But if  they are looking  at  lock-­‐in  for  their  next  game,  it’s  a  problem because  they   
never  built  a  direct  relationship  with  the  person  who  plays  Angry  Birds.  There  is  no   
Angry  Birds  newsletter.  There  is  no  Angry  Birds  universe  that  makes  it  more  likely   
to  play  a new game  from Angry  Birds’  company  Rovio  as  opposed  to  one  from their   
competitors.   
**Ideas that  Spread **  
_**Q: Apple  has  all  the  cards  with  the  customer’s  information…so if  you  want  to**_  
_**develop  an  iPhone  app,  how  do you  get  around  that? **_  
The  app  market  is  in  large  measure  a  sucker’s  game  for  a  few  reasons.   
Reason  number  one  is  no  one’s  ever  heard  of  you  and  there  are  a  million apps to  
choose  from.  It’s  the  biggest haystack and  you’re  a little  tiny  needle.    
Number  two  is  once  you  finally  get  someone  to  hear  from you,  who  wants  to   
hear  from you,  most  apps  forgot  to  be  social—Instagram being  the  exception.   
Instagram works  better  because  I  get  all  my  friends  to  use  it.  All  I  need  to  do  is   
get Kelly and then Kelly is going to get five of you and if one out of five of you get   
someone  else,  I  go  to  infinity.   
Whereas  if  you  make  me  an  app  of,  “I  look  up  and  I  can see the stars,” that’s  
really  cool,  but  if  I’m not  going  to  tell  10  friends  about your  app. It’s  a dead  end. It  
doesn’t  scale.    
So  we’re  stuck  with  it’s  a  big  haystack  and  most  apps  don’t  lend  themselves  to   
spreading.    
Then the third thing kicks  in. If  you want  to sell  your app, you have this big  
problem which  is  no  one  knows  how  good  your  app  is  until  they  give  you  money.   
And  people  don’t  like  doing  that  with  digital  goods.  They  like  doing  it  with  other   
things  in their  lives.    
We  don’t go  to  a restaurant  and  say,  “Let  me  eat  here  then  let  me  pay  you  if  I   
think it’s  good.” But we  do  it with  digital stuff.    
We  don’t ever  buy  a record  until we’ve  heard  it on the  radio  first for  free. The   
radio  is  this  huge  wonderful  sampling  tool  that  made  the  music  industry  work.    
   
28   

* * *

   
   
In the app world  we have a bunch of  apps  that say free, but if  you use it a lot,  
you’ll  pay  for  it.  That’s  brilliant.  Free  is  a  great  sampling  tool  and  if  they’re  not  using   
it  a  lot, they shouldn’t  pay for it  anyway. If they are, they’re not  going to  fight you to   
pay  for  it  because  it’s  giving  them what  they  were  hoping  for.   
That  means  the  most  important  thing  you  can  do  with  an  app  is  making  sure  it’s   
viral. _\[I  didn’t  call  it  viral  on  your  mug.  I  think  I  called  it  fungal,  because I  think  fungal _  
_is  more powerful  because it  works  in  the dark  too\]._   
Make  it  fungal  meaning  you  don’t  have  to  be  famous.  You  don’t  have  to  be  the   
most  popular  video  on  Youtube,  not  that  Joseph  Kony  thing.  It  can  quietly  in  the   
dark  go  from person  to  person  growing  among  a  circle of people.   
_**Q: Well  certain  ideas  don’t  lend  themselves  to being  viral… **_  
Absolutely,  and  Atlantic  Avenue  is  a  really  stupid  place  to  build  a  house.  Because   
houses cost  $150 each, but  the rent  with one house is only $110. Don’t  build on  
Atlantic.   
Given  that  you  can  build  whatever  you  want,  don’t  build  something  that  isn’t   
going to work.    
There are all  these apps in which the person who built  the app thought  it  was a   
good  idea.  And  if  everyone  knew  what  they  knew  it  would  be  fine,  but  everyone  will   
never  know what you know.    
What  you  can  do  if  you  want  is  say,  “No.  I’m going  to  build  an  app  that  I  have  to   
sell  straight  to each person who uses it.”  That’s the way the world worked for 100  
years. That’s fine, but  you better price it  so that  the cost  of selling it is built into your   
profit.    
When  I  was  selling  the  games  at  Yoyodyne  for  $100  thousand  or  $1  million  each,   
I  went  personally.  I  got  into  a  plane  and  flew  there.  It  took  us  six  months  to  make  a   
sale. Our costs of goods were literally zero, other than the  people. But we  had  to   
charge  you  a  lot  because  I  had  to  go  to  all  these  meetings  where  no  one  ever  bought   
from me.   
If  your  app  costs  $5  and  you  have  to  have  a  meeting  with  someone  to  get  them to   
buy  it,  you’re  in  really  big  trouble.  But  maybe  it’s  a  $500 app  and you  can afford to  
do it  because every sale costs $100. That  works.    
I’ll  use  the  Al  Gore  eBook  as  a  great  example  of  the  mistake  that  all  these  people   
are  making.   
The  Al  Gore  book  was  beautiful.  It  costs  them hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars   
to  make  and  it  lost  a  fortune.  Other  than  magazines  writing  about  how  great  it  was,   
no  one  ever  heard  about  it.  And  how  many  people  read  about  an  app  in  a  magazine   
and  say,  “Oh  I’m going  to  go  get  my  iPad,  press  a  few  buttons,  pay  the  money,  and

download it.”  Not  enough.  And  once  I  had  it,  there  was  no  reason  to  tell  my  friends.   
It  didn’t  work  better  if  my  friends  were  using  it.   
The  magic  of  the  iPad  and  the  magic  of  the  web  isn’t  that  it  looks  cool  on  the   
screen. That  was CD-­‐ROM years ago which I used to do.  The  magic  is  it  works  better   
when your  friends  and  your  colleagues  are  using it too.    
**No  one  wants  to  have  the  only  e-­mail  account  in  the   
world.  It’s  useless.  Once  you  have  e-­mail,  you  want   
everyone to  have e-­mail.  That’s  what  makes  it  work **  
**better. **  
37Signals  spends  zero  dollars  on  traditional  marketing.  All  they  need  is  one   
person  in  this  room to  use  it  and  then  those  people  do  the  marketing.   
I’m raising  my  voice  here  a  little  because  I  really  want  to  hammer  this  home.   
You’re  not entitled  to  the  business you want.    
I  can  help  you  make  it  the  best  it  can  be  given  the  constraints,  but  you  guys  are   
starting with no constraints.    
**The  Customer  Funnel **  
  
   
30   

* * *

   
   
So  there’s  this  funnel.  The  top  is  everybody  in  the  United  States  or  North  America.   
The  bottom is  customers  who  gave  you  money.  And  the  funnel  is  leaky.  People  drip   
out  of  it.  They  don’t  all  come  out  the  bottom.   
When you think about the  fact that they  have to be divorced, talk  to a  lawyer,  
talk to  a lawyer  that’s  charging by  a flat flee, and  talk to  a lawyer  that’s  charging a  
flat  fee who knows you, the challenge you  have is you  have to be very cognizant  of  
how  many  people  are  in  the  universe  left  at  the  bottom and  price  accordingly.   
If  the  value  you  are  creating  is  really  significant  and  the  cost  of  making  the  sale  is   
really high,  then  it’s not  $5.  Right?  Maybe it’s a  $1000 service.  Maybe it’s an  app  that   
we  talked  about  a  minute  ago.  It  has  to  match  the  funnel  that  you  are going to create  
for it.    
If  you’re  evangelical  and  want  to  transform the  way  people  get  divorced,  that’s  a   
totally  different discussion.    
If  you  came  to  us  and  say  “I’m going  to  use  technology  as  the  wedge  to  change   
the  way  people  get divorced  and  my  model  is  mint.com,”  which  was  bought  by   
Quicken for  nine  figures.    
Then I say, “Oh there is a  whole bunch of things one could do to dis-­‐intermediate   
lawyers  and  make  getting  divorced  way  faster  and  less  painful.  I’m going  to  build  a   
whole  suite  of  stuff  and  go  straight  to  the  world  so  that  every  time  someone  says   
they’re  getting  divorced,  the  first  thing  people  say  to  them is,  “Have  you seen \_\_\_\_\_\_?”    
That’s an audacious, big, fat, hairy thing to go after, and you can probably find  
some  people  who  would  give  you  the  money  to  get  you  there,  or  at  least  have  a  shot   
of getting there. But  you got  to be very careful  not  to do part  of it  without  doing all  of  
it.    
If  the  mediator  wakes  up  every  morning  with  a  problem,  that’s  one  of  the  things   
you have  to  think  about.  “What  problem is  my  customer  waking  up  in  the  morning   
with?”    
The  mediator  wakes  up  in  the  morning  and  says,  “I  need  to  get  more  of  my  share   
of  mediation  things,”  and  you  say  to  that  mediator,  “This  tool  comes  with  a   
dashboard that  shows back up on your  screen and  there’s  this  huge  incentive  for   
you to be able to offer it  because they’re going to get  you new  clients.”  Then when  
you  call  on  the  mediator  and  say  that  sentence,  the  mediator  is  going  to  say,  “I’ve   
been  waiting  for  someone  to  do that”  or they’re not  going to listen to you.   
But again it goes  back to:  do  people  know you? Do  they trust you? Will they  
listen to  your  story? Does  their  story  resonate  enough  with  you that you’re  willing  
to  give  it a try?   
And  the  last  part  of  this  and  then we’re going to go on.    
   
31   

* * *

   
   
**If you  have  100  of these  mediators  who  are  your   
customers,  you’re  job  is not  to  find  more  customers  
for  your  product.  Your  job  is  to  find  more  products **  
**for  your  customers. **  
Because  now  there  are  100  people  who  have  said,  I’m willing to use technology  
to  get  more  clients  to  service  my  clients  better  and  make  more  money.   
Then  you  sit  there  and  don’t  say,  “How  do  I  get  more  mediators?”  You  say,  “What   
other  tools  are  available  to  these  mediators  so  I  can  use  the  connection  economy  to   
do it?   
For  example,  how  can  I  start  showing  bar  charts  and  other  sorts  of  information   
to  the  mediator’s  clients  so  they  can  see,  compared  to  other  couples  who  make  as   
much  as  you  do,  this  is  how  this  usually  goes.”   
If  you’re  the  arbiter  of  community  standards, you can never  be replaced, because  
you’re the one who has the data.    
The point  right  now  isn’t  to answer the  question,  “what  problem is  my  customer   
waking up with?”   
The point  now  is to know  the question is essential. That’s what  I want  you to be  
thinking about.    
You can change  this  to  anything you want and  if  you want to, you can open a  
kayaking school. That’s  how early  in the  deal it is.    
What do  you want to  change  it  into  so  that  you’re  not  always  climbing  up  uphill   
so  there’s  something  in  it  that  the  wind  is  in  your  back?   
**What  is the  Hard  Part? **  
What’s  the  hard  part of  your  business? If  your  business  doesn’t have  a hard  part, you  
don’t  have a  business.    
I would  argue  the easy part of  your  business  in the case of  \[intentionally  
inaudible\] is the app.  You  could  make  this  app  in  three  weeks. The app isn’t hard   
and  if  it’s  90%  of  what it could  be  or  110%  of  what it could  be, it’s  not going to   
matter.  The  hard  part  is  finding  somebody  who  is  a  middleman  who  will  make  you   
successful.   
When I think about each  of  you and  the  business  you want to  create, you got to   
understand  what’s  the  hard  part  and  spend  all  your  time  on  that.   
I constantly run into people and  ask, “How’s  your  project doing?”    
   
32   

* * *

   
   
“Well,  I  filed  the  DBA certificate,  we’ve  been  incorporated,  I  think  I’ve  got  some   
office  space  coming,  and  I  hired  the  guy  to  do  the  logo…”  And  they  go  through  the   
list  of  all  the  stuff  that  doesn’t  matter  because  it’s  easy.  They  should  have spent  a  $1  
on  it  and  moved  on.   
**Your  logo  is  never  the  hard  part.  **  
It just isn’t.   
All  the  time  you’re  spending  on  your  logo  is  the  time  you’re  hiding  from doing   
the  hard  part.  And  the  hard  part  is  often  being  known,  being  trusted,  or  being  able  to   
create  something  that  occurs  that  people  can’t  live  without.   
This  is  different  from what  is the scarce part. Scarcity is the only thing worth  
paying  for.  If  you  make  something  that  is  incredibly  abundant  and  everyone  has  it,   
you  won’t  be  able  to  sell  it.  But  you  can  create  scarcity  by  doing  something  that  isn’t   
particularly difficult.    
**Creating Scarcity **  
If  James  Taylor  decides  to  put  out  a  concert  and  there  are  only  200  seats,  he  created   
scarcity  and  he  can  sell  those  seats  for  $1,000  each  and  make  $200,000  in  an  hour.   
What he  did  that was  hard  was  surviving being a heroin addict, being a great  singer,  
and  doing  it  for  40  years.  That’s  hard.  But  creating  scarcity  in  that  moment  was  easy.   
So  you  got  to  think  about,  “What  am I  doing  here  that  is  both  hard  and  scarce?”   
As  I  use  this,  as  it  grows,  as  it  catches  on—does  it  become  more  valuable  or  less  
valuable?   
If  we  think  about  this,  we  think  about  somebody  who  is  trying  to  create   
collectible  fine  art.  Andy  Warhol  has  showed  that  you  can  cross  this  chasm and   
become  valuable  just  because  you’re  everywhere.  But  generally  the  more  times  you   
paint the Mona  Lisa  over and over again, the less it’s worth.    
There  are  other  things  that  become  more  valuable  as  more  and  more  people  use   
them like  e-­‐mail.  If  e-­‐mail  was  held  hostage,  the  universe  would  pay  more  to  keep  e-­‐  
mail  then  it  would  have  paid  15  years  ago.  As  people  use  it  more,  it  becomes  more   
valuable because we get  dependant  on it.    
Someone  is  here  who’s  doing  a  philanthropic  thing  in  their  town—Kelly.   
When six philanthropists  are  involved  in what you are  doing, is  it worth  less  or   
more  than  when  100  philanthropists  are  involved?    
For  some  people  their  worldview  is,  “I  like  being  part  of  an  exclusive  early   
adopter  group.”  Then  it’s  less  valuable  because  there’s  more  people  in.  It’s  so   
crowded  no  one  goes  there  anymore.   
   
33   

* * *

   
   
Other  people  like  the  fact that it’s  crowded  and  so  it’s  more  valuable.   
So  we  have  to  think  about  as  this  project  scales,  is  that  going  to  make  it  better  or   
worse?   
**Stealing Ideas **  
The  first  question  is:  “Is  someone  going  to  steal  my  idea?”  And  the  answer  is   
probably not.    
As  your  discovering  here, there  are  ideas  all of  you have that have great chances   
of working and very few  of you are busy thinking about  how  you are going to do it.  
Even though you’ve already decided  you want to be entrepreneurs, it’s  not as  easy  
as  stealing the  idea.   
So Twitter  starts  catching  on,  and  yeah  there’s  Yammer  or  whatever  it  is  and   
people  have  came  up  with  variations,  but  in  general,  that’s  not  your  problem.   
**Your  problem  isn’t  that  people  are  copying.  You’re   
problem  is  not  enough  people  are  copying. **  
As  you  try  to  interact  with  the  tribe,  as  you  try  to  make  a  ruckus,  being  the  one   
and  only  is  usually  a  problem.   
If  you were the one and  only fashion label, you would  fail because the  
marketplace  wouldn’t  care  about  fashion.  It’s  Vogue  magazine  and  competitors  that   
make  fashion  work.  Tommy  Hilfiger  wants  Ralph  Lauren  to  be  in  business,  not  out  of   
business.    
**Tribes **  
When  I  talk  about  tribes,  I  don’t  mean  nearly  a  group  of  people.  So  left-­‐handed  
people, not a tribe. I can identify with all the left-­‐handed people in the world, but   
they  don’t  care  about  each  other.  A tribe  has  to  have  a  goal,  a  culture,  a  community,   
they  have  to  care.   
If  I  talk  about  gay  men  in  America,  they’re  not  a  tribe.   
There  are  subsets  of  gay  men  in  America,  the  ones  that  care  about  the   
Christopher Street history  and  go  to  a parade, that’s  a tribe. For  sure. They  can look  
at  each  other  and  give  the  headshake.  They’re  wearing  the  same  thing.  They  talk  the   
same  stories.  That’s  a  tribe.   
You  will  always  do  better  if  you’re  building  something  in  the  connection   
economy  if  the  tribe  embraces  you.  We’re  hard  wired  to  do  what  other  people  are   
doing.

How  many  of  you  know  about  Tom shoes?  Very  clever  idea.  Buy  a  pair  of   
alpargatas  and  he  gives  an  identical  pair  to  someone  who’s  never  worn  a  pair  of   
shoes  in  their  life.  Why  doesn’t  everyone  in  America  wear  Tom shoes?   
Because  Blake  didn’t start with  everyone, he  started  with  a very specific Daily  
Candy reading,  urban  dwelling  29-­‐year-­‐old  woman  who  wears  a certain thing and   
recognizes  other  women  like  her.  That  was  brilliant  because  you  only  have  to  get   
100  of  those  women  before  you  get  a  1,000  because  the  tribe  is  in  sync.   
You can’t light it forever. Soon they are  going to  go  on to  the  next fashion. So he  
has  cleverly  said,  “So  now  that  I  got  this,  I’m going  to  go  talk  to  this  group  of  people.”   
It’s  ok  with  you  that  this  might  move  to  other  tribes.  If  you  got  it  right,  you’re   
going  to  have  enough  momentum that  you  can  go  faster  than  all  these  other  people  
because  they’re  afraid  and  you’re  not  because  you’ve  seen  it  from the  inside.   
But the  other  thing the  resistance  speaks  up about is  this, “I don’t want to  pick  
one  tribe,  because  if  that  tribe  rejects  me,  I  will  have  failed.  I  want  to  pick  20  tribes  
because  there’s  always  another  one.”   
As  soon  as  you  pick  20  tribes,  the  tribe  knows  that  and  they  know  you’re  not   
obsessed  with  them.  They’re  going  to  become  less  obsessed  with  you  as  a  result.  It’s   
a self-­‐fulfilling prophecy.    
If  you’re playing the field and you’re at  a  singles bar, it’s way less likely that   
you’re  going  to  get  married  because  the  people  in  that  room have  a  different   
attitudes  about each  other.    
If  you go to the industry and  this  is  it—we  care  about  you,  we’re  committed  to   
you—and  you work  you’re  way  in  that  industry,  you’re  way  more  likely  to  convert   
that  tribe.  And  then  you  can  take  the  stories  from that  tribe  and  you  go  to  your  next   
tribe.   
That  is the place to start, but  you have to define the tribe.    
The  tribe  might  not  be  how  old  they  are  or  where  they  live.  It  might  be  they’re   
big  fans  of  vintage  Rolling  Stone  records.  You  can’t  tell  from looking  at  someone  if   
they’re  that  kind  of  person,  but  you  know  they  are  all  reading  the  same  magazine,   
the  same  newsletter,  or  the  same  whatever.

**APPEALING  TO CONSUMERS **  
**  The  Sales Funnel **  
Now  back  to  this  funnel  because  its  one  of  my  favorite  drawings  and  then  I’m going   
to  draw the  Rogers  curve.    
Do  you  all  know  how  Google  makes  billions  of  dollars  every  month  in  profit?   
Those little ads next  to the search results. Do you know  how  they price the ads?  You  
pay  by  the  click.  But  how  do  they  decide  how  much  a  click  costs?  It’s  an  auction.  This   
is unbelievably brilliant  what  they did. Bill  Gross sort  of invented it  and Google  
figured  out  how  to  maximize  it.   
Here  are  all  the  people  who  are  searching  for  something  and  I  run  an  ad  saying   
there  is  a  side  effect  of  Viagra  where  it’s  discovered  that  it  makes  your ears get   
bigger.   
I buy an ad  on Google that says  “Ears  getting bigger? Click here to join our   
lawsuit,” and  I put it up next to  the  word  Viagra.    
That’s  going  to  cost  me  $8  a  click.  Let’s  say  5%  of  the  people  who  see  this  ad  click   
on it. I only have to  pay  $8  for  each  one.  They  come  to  my  website.  How  much  does  it   
cost  to  get  that  person  to  my  website?  $8   
Let’s  say  1  out  of  10  people  who  see  that  click  on  the  next  page  to  learn  more   
about  my  firm.  How  much  does  it  cost  me  to  get  somewhere  here?  $80.  _\[Does  anyone_  
_not  understand  why it’s  $80,  this  is  really important.  I  have to  multiply by 10.  Yes?\]_   
Now  let’s  say  1  out  of  5  those  people  give  me  their  e-­‐mail  address  so  I  can  follow   
up  with  them.  How  much  does  it  cost  me  to  get  an  e-­‐mail  address?  $400.   
And  let’s  say  that I e-­‐mail  people  the  newsletter  blah  blah  blah  and  1  out  of  10  of   
them join  my  class  action  lawsuit  with  the  big  ear  problem.  How  much  does  it  cost   
me  every  client?  $4,000.  That’s  how  much  it  cost  me  to  make  a  sale  using  this  thing.   
If  I succeed  in  my  case  against  Pfizer,  I’m going  to  make  $100,000  per  person  in   
profit  because  that’s  how  much  my  legal  fees  will  be  which  is  great.  Clearly  I  should   
buy  as  many  of  these  people  as  I  can  for  $4,000  because  my  revenue  from each  one   
is $100,000. Do you see why?  Make sense?   
_\[Instead  of  me picking  a  big  lawsuit  I  could  pick  I’m  selling  the melon  of  the month _  
_club,  the math  still  works.\] _  
So  now,  someone  else  sees  what  I’m doing,  goes  to  Google,  and  says,  “I’m going  to   
pay $16  a click.”    
If  the cost of  the  click  goes  up  to  $16,  what’s  my  cost  of  a  sale  go  to?  $8,000.  The   
answer  is  cost-­‐per-­‐click  doubled, so cost-­‐per-­‐sale doubles.

This  is  magic  because  who’s  taking  all  the  profit  off  the  table?  I’m willing  to  keep   
in the bidding war until  I get  to $99,000. I’ll  just  keep  paying  more  and  more  and   
more  because  it’s  worth  it  to  me.   
All  the  profit  goes  to  the  auction.  Google  is  clearing  the  board  in  every  single   
industry  that  does  online  anything  because  they  get  to  keep  the  money.  With  me?   
Now,  if  your  competitor  realizes  that  you  don’t  need  two  pages  to  get  someone’s   
e-­‐mail  address,  but  only  one  page,  they’re  going  to  be  five  times  more  efficient  as   
you are at  running this funnel. Their cost  of a sale is going down by 80%. See why?   
Suddenly they can bid a fortune  for  these  links.  You  can’t  afford  them anymore.  And   
they’re  going  to  get  all  the  customers.   
This  funnel  is  exactly  the  same  thing  that  happens  if  you  have  a  sales  force.   
It’s  exactly  the  same  thing  that  happens  if  you  have  ads  that  run  in  magazines.   
It’s  exactly  the  same  thing  that  happens  if  you’re  buying  shelf  space  from Whole   
Foods.   
In  every  case,  there  is  an  amount  of  money  you’re  willing  to  pay  to  get  the   
attention  of  the  masses  and  there’s  an  amount  of  money  you  get  at  the  bottom for   
the  cost of  making  a  sale.   
I’m going  to  let  this  one  sink  in  for  a  minute  because  this  going  to  transform the   
magic.   
One  of  the  things  entrepreneurs  do  is  we  believe  in  magic  and  say  “I’m going  to   
build  this  great  thing,  and  a  miracle  happens,  and  I’m rich.”  And  it’s  that  “And  a   
miracle  happens  part”  that  I’m concerned  with.   
So  Kit  needs  to  reach  mostly  tourists  who  are  coming  to  Miami  so  they  will  pay   
her  $125  to  use  some  of  her  services  that  she  offers—tours  and  Vespas  and  things   
like  that. The  only  reason she  doesn’t  have  a  million  customers  is  because  she  can’t   
figure out  an efficient  funnel  to get  in front  of a  tourist  on the right  day with the  
right  story  so  that  tourist  then  listens  to  her  story  again,  comes  to  her  facility,  and   
hands  over  their  $125.  And  if  you  fix  this  problem,  everything  else  will  take  care  of   
itself.    
When we  think about the  business  we  say,    
**“How  do  I  change  not the  funnel,  but the  business   
itself so  that it makes  it more  likely  that my  funnel**  
**gets  more efficient?” **  
You  may  have  seen  these tours they have in various cities where they use old  
World  War  II  amphibious  boats.  They  drive  through  the  city,  it  hits  the  river,  and   
drives  in  the  river  as  a  boat.  They  call  them Duck  tours  and  they  give  everyone  on   
   
37   

* * *

![](SETH-GODIN-STARTUP-SCHOOL-FINAL-38_1.png)  
   
   
the  boat this  really  annoying Duck noise thing. Why would you do that? Duck noise  
machines  are  expensive.   
The answer is because what  are tourists doing?  They’re walking around. While  
they’re  walking around, this  boatload  with  wheels  of  happy  tourists  quacking like   
ducks goes by.    
The act  of  running  their  business  is  also  making  their  funnel  better  because  right   
on  the  side  of  their  boat  is  their  phone  number.  That  is  the  only  method  they  need  to   
get  more  tourists  to  get  on  the  next  boat—the  act  of  doing  it  in  front  of  them.  So   
when I think of  Hanz  and  his  thing,  a  lot  of  the  time  that  these  guys  are  out  there   
with  their  pitch,  they’re  doing  it  to  someone  who  might  become  his  next  customer.   
Or  the  guy who  runs  fancy fortune  cookies, a business  I think out of  Georgia.  
They’re  the  number  one  fortune  cookie  maker  in  America.  They  will  make  fortune   
cookies  for  your  company  event  blah,  blah,  blah.  The  number  one  way  for  him to   
grow  would  be  to  offer  a  discount  if  you’re  willing  to  let  him put  his  URL  on  the  back   
of the fortune. Because every single person who’s at  an event  opens it  up and says,  
“Oh  that’s  clever”—they  see  on the  back how to  order  cookies  for  _their_  event.   
So again, short circuiting the funnel as it grows   
**Diffusion  of Innovations **  
  
This is the bell  curve—the  normal  distribution.  For  the  liberal artists  in the  back  
row,  if  I  ask  all  of  you  to  get  in  height  order  from 4  foot  to  7  foot  and  I  measured,   
what I would  see  is  a couple  people  who  weren’t very  tall, a couple  people  who  are   
very  tall,  and  most  of  you  in  the  middle.

If  I  organized  any  group  of  people  I  meet  on  the  street  by  hair  length  or  the   
number  of  CDs  they  own,  it  would  be  exactly  the  same.  There  would  be  a  whole   
bunch  of  people  who  own  one  CD,  another  few  who  own  10,000  CDs,  and  most   
people  in  the  middle.  This  distributes  for  almost  everything  in  nature.   
If  we talk about worldviews, it turns  out that we always  distribute in the  
following way:    
There  are  a  few  people  who  like  to  buy  stuff  merely  because  it’s  new.  These  are   
the  people  who  use  to  watch  all their  TV  on a Tivo, but now watch it on an iPad   
instead because it’s cooler.   
Then there are people who waited until  the DVD player was $80 at  Wal-­‐Mart  
before  they  bought  one.  They  are  the  masses.  There  are  a  lot  of  them.      
And  then  there  are  people  who  still  have  a 12:00  flashing on their  VCR.    
If  we  think  about  the  market  for  shoes,  there  are  women  who  read  Vogue   
magazine  for  the  Ads  and  people  who  buy  six  pairs  of  New  Balance  at  a  time  and   
they  don’t back to  Zappos  for six  more  years.  And  you  have  to  think  really  hard  in  
the  group you are  thinking about.    
Are  you  selling  a  product  that’s  going  to  appeal  to  early  adopters  because  it’s   
new?    
Or  are  you  selling  something  that’s  going  to  appeal  to  people  only  when  they   
have to because everyone has it?   
Or  are  you trying  to  appeal  to  the  masses?   
These  are  fundamental  different  groups  of  people.  And  this  is  where  technology   
people  got  in  trouble  for  a  long  time.   
There is this theory that  the Boston Consulting Group put  out  there. You would  
make  something  for  the  geeks  and  as  you  made  it  more  and  more  it  would  get   
cheaper  to  make  because  that’s  what  happens  with  digital  goods.  It  would  become   
more  popular  so  you  could  just  ride  the  wave  to  the  masses.   
And  that  happens  once  in  a  very  long  while,  but  not  often.  The  reason  is because  
between  here  \[the  geeks\]  and  here  \[the  masses\]  is  a  chasm.  A big  gap.  This  chasm is   
because  these  people  want  something  that’s  cool  and  these  people  want  something   
that works.   
If  we think about the typical app on the iPhone or  the iPad, there’s  a bunch  of   
people who buy it right away because it’s  cool. But these people don’t want to hear   
about  that.  They  want  a  completely  different  story.  “That  it  is  a  complete  solution,”   
has  nothing  to  do  with  cool.  And  that  gap,  that  chasm,  is  in  a  book  by  Jeff  Moore  
called  “Crossing  the  Chasm”  and  it’s  where  a  lot  of  you  will  get  into  trouble.

What  you  have  to  think  about  is:  “Am I  happy  being  a  small  enough  business  or  a   
freelancer  that  all  I  need  is  a  few  early  adopters  and  I  can  declare  victory?  Or  am I   
building  something  for  the  masses  and  it  doesn’t  work  until  I  have  the  masses?   
If  you read  Tech Crunch and  all those other  online blogs, they are entranced  by  
new cutting edge businesses.    
Did  you  see  that  one  that  got  $40  million  dollars  in  funding  called  Color?  It’s this  
big  thing.  All  the  1  million  people  who  tried  the  new  thing—there’s  1  million  of  them  
that  all  got  it  and  it  completely  failed  down  to  zero.  The  company  raised  $40  million   
dollars and had to start  over. They’re on their third try now  because it  doesn’t  work   
unless  they have 10-­‐20  million  users.  So  it  doesn’t  do  them any  good  to  come  up   
with  something  hip.  They  have  to  come  up  with  something  for  everyone  to  use.   
**Mrs.  Sripraphai  and  the  Curve **  
Let’s say it’s 20 years ago and you  are one of the few  people  who  move  here  from  
Thailand  who  can  actually  cook  really  well  in  some  sort  of  volume.  You  look  around   
and  say, “There  are  no  good  Thai  restaurants  in New York City of  all places. There   
ought  to  be  a  lot  of  them.”   
The instinct  of the entrepreneur  is,  “All  right  great this  is  better  Thai food;  I’ll  
win.” But that’s  not the  way  it works.    
So  I  want  to  take  you  through  Mrs.  Sripraphai’s  thinking  and  how  it  came  to  be   
that  her  restaurant  makes  millions  and  millions  of  dollars  in  Queens,  way  off  the   
beaten path  on the  seven train and  how she  got there.    
First  of  all,  how  does  someone  like  me,  a  customer  she  needs  because  I’m willing   
to  drive  to  Queens  to  have  jungle  curry, find  out that this  restaurant even exists?    
How  do you  use tribes,  early adopter thinking, and  cost of  sales  to  grow a little   
tiny  restaurant that literally  only  had  four  tables  the  first few years  she  was  open to   
one  that’s  now  eight  times  the  size  with  a  patio  in  the  back  and  another  branch  still   
closed  on  Wednesdays  a  few  miles  away?   
It starts  with this. In this  distribution of  people in New York who go out to eat,  
there’s  a group here  that want to  go  to  places  that haven’t been in the  New York  
Times  yet.  And  this  group  was  organized  by  a  guy  named  Jim Leff.  Jim started  a  site   
called  Chowhound.com.   
Chowhound.com was  the  tribal  watering  hole  for  people  who  wanted  to  give   
each  other  the  buzz  on  something  that  was  new.  At  its  peak,  300,000  people  a  month   
used  chowhound. Half  were probably in New York City and  of  the half  (150,000),  
probably only 50,000  were  interested  in Thai  food. Of  the  50,000, probably only  
10,000 were going to go to Queens.    
   
40   

* * *

   
   
So  there  were  only  10,000  people  who  mattered  to  Mrs.  Sripraphai  other  than   
her  tiny  community  of  Thai  people.  But  she  couldn’t  make  the  business work  at  the  
level she  wanted  if  it was  just for  Thai  people.   
Instead  of  doing what every other  Thai restaurant does  which is, “We have Pad   
Thai,  come  here,”  she  said,  “We  don’t  have  Pad  Thai,  and  if  you’re  not  one  of  the   
10,000 people, you’re probably not  going  to  like  this  place.  And  we’re  going  to  serve   
stinky long beans and crispy water cress salad, but  we’re not  even going to put  it  on  
the  menu  because  your  either  an  insider  or  you’re  not.  And  if  you’re  an  insider,   
you’re  welcome  here.”   
By  making  the  perfect restaurant for  those 10,000  people, what she did  was   
make  it  irresistible  to  those  10,000  people  because  there  was  no  place  else.  She  had   
a  monopoly  on  interesting  Thai  food  in  New  York  City  15-­‐20 years ago.    
So what happens?   
It turns  out that chowhounds  talk a lot. When you go out to dinner, you rarely go  
by  yourself,  so  you  bring  other  people  with  you.  Some  of  the  people  you  bring  with   
you  don’t  like  it.  That  goes  against  everything  most  entrepreneurs  stand  for.      
Fine with her.    
“If  you  don’t  like  it,  don’t  come  back.  But  if  you  do  like  it,  I  have  a  monopoly  on   
this  for  a while—for  this  group  before  you  get  bored.  You’re  going  to  have  to  come   
back.”   
At  that  point  someone  from the  New  York  Times,  who’s  trying  to  please  his  boss  
by  writing  about  something  that  hasn’t  been  written  about  before,  steals  some  of  the   
insight  from the  Chowhound  people  and  goes  to  the  restaurant.  He  writes  a  two  star   
review  of a  restaurant  where it’s not  very expensive and there are no tablecloths.   
This  is  very  unusual  in  New  York.  This  was  an  important  thing.  It  was  a  spin  of   
the  wheel. It didn’t have  to  happen, but it did  happen.    
And  so,  when  the  New  York  Times  gives  it  two  stars,  something  occurs  which  is  a   
whole  bunch  of  people  who’s  worldview is,  “I  don’t  go  to  Queens,”  have  a  problem  
which  is, “I always  eat at restaurants  that get at least two  stars  in the  New York  
Times.  Conflict.   
A lot  of  those  people  went  and  tried  this  restaurant  because  it’s  now  moving   
through  the  curve  of  the  population and  it has  trust and  authority because they  
found  out  about  it  from someone  who  they  trusted.   
At  that  point  an  interesting  thing  happens.   
Zagats has at  the front  of the book  a  ranking  of the highest  ranked restaurants.   
Well Mrs. Sripraphai  had  picked  a category  that  was  almost  empty.  And  she  had   
   
41   

* * *

   
   
10,000 Chowhound’s on her side plus a  whole bunch of people who didn’t  know   
what  good  Thai  food  tasted  like,  but  knew  the  Times  had  given  it  two  stars.   
These  groups  of  people  ended  up  giving  her  a  huge  rating.  For  many years she  
was  one  of  the  top five  ranked  restaurants  in all of  New York City  at any  price   
because  this  reporting  system was  in  her  favor.  Does  that  make  sense?   
Now  she’s  moving  through  the  curve.  She’s  doubled  the  size  and  she’s  doubled   
the  size  again. Now  she has 30-­‐40  tables  and  it’s  busy  all  the  time,  except  on   
Wednesdays. You know that I’ve  been there  on Wednesdays  and  have  been broken  
hearted.  So  she’s  moving  through  this  curve.   
We  can talk about the  whole  life  thing, that she  also  loves  it. She  also loves being  
able  to  make  this  cultural  statement  with  her  work,  etc.  But  if  we  look  at  this  as  a   
business  and  compare  it  to  the  40,000  other  restaurants  in  New  York  City  that   
weren’t  smart  enough  to  do  this,  you  see  what  I’m talking  about.   
She could have built  it  anywhere she wanted. She could have structured it   
anyway  she  wanted.  She  could  have  priced  it  on  the  menu  anyway  she  wanted.   
One  of  her  competitors  from Las  Vegas  opened  one  in  a  better  location  in   
Manhattan with  white  tablecloths  at  three  times the price and it  failed. The reason it   
failed  wasn’t  because  it  was  more  expensive.  It’s  because  they  didn’t  guess  properly   
about how to  tell the  story and  what would  happen when people  got there—that  
when  you  got  there,  their  menu  was  too  small  and  it  seemed  too  ordinary.   
As  Chowhounds,  we  all  raced  there  the  first  day  because  this  place  in  Las   
Vegas—some  of  us  fly  to  Las  Vegas  just  to  eat  there—and  now it’s  in New York and   
it  disappointed us because they were trying to go here right  away. They skipped the   
tribe  leaders. They  skipped  the  dues  paying process  to  work their  way  up as  they   
were  trying to  do  this.    
_**Q: How  much  of  that  would  you  say is  deliberate?  How  much  of  it  is  this  is  just   
the  way she  cooks,  this  is  the  way she… **_  
I  think  that  she  had  naïve  wisdom.  I’ve  given  her  my  books  and  we’ve  talked  a   
little  about  this.  I  think  most  people  who  meet  her  say  that  she’s  idiosyncratic.   
Sometimes  idiosyncratic  people  end  up  failing  because  they’re  not  in  sync  with  the   
universe. She  happened  to be. So when a Chowhound  showed  up, she didn’t shun  
the  person  for  not  being  Thai.  She  would  take  10  minutes  to  explain  what  nam phrik   
is and why you want  to dip your carrots in it. That  was her instinct, but  it  happened  
to  work.    
But I’ve  also  seen people who have done it on purpose—people who open a  
business  that’s  supposed  to  be  exclusive.  Even  though  it’s  empty  in  the  back,  you   
don’t  let  people  in  or  you  make  them wait  behind  the  velvet  rope.  Well  they  like  the   
velvet  rope. That’s why they’re there.

Or  all these  businesses  that hire  people  to  bring their  friends  the  first couple   
weeks  that  it’s  open.  You  can  hire  a  publicist  to  get  celebrities  to  come.  All  of  those   
things  are  all keying into  that tiny  group of  10,000  people  to  delight. Then it  worked  
its way through if you get  the other pieces of it  correct.

_**A: I  don’t  want  to waste  my time. **_  
And  you  don’t  want  to  fail.   
**All  of  us  have  lots  of  interests,  but  we  always  figure **  
**out  what  to eat  for  lunch. **  
We  don’t  say,  “If  I  can’t  decide  if  I  should  have  the  sandwich  or  the  pasta…”   
Right?  At  some  point  you  have  something  to  eat  for  lunch  because  the  cost  of  failure   
is tiny. You will  not  be crushed because the pasta  isn’t  as good as the sandwich  
would  have  been.  You  just  eat  something.   
**The  posture,  the  dynamic  is  this:  picking  nothing  is   
guaranteed  to  not  work.  Picking something has  to  be**  
**better  than  that. **  
The  discipline,  and  I  speak  from experience  because  when  I  was  a  book  packager   
we  had  a database  of  100s and 100s of book  ideas in it. How  do you  decide which  
book  idea  to  pursue?  How  do  you  decide  which  to  spend  a  month  on  spec  for?  Well   
the  answer  is  the  bestseller  is  always  a surprise. The  businesses  that work always   
amaze  the  pundits.

Given that  no one knows, you just  have to pick. It’s not  about  being right, it’s  
about being—about  putting  in  the  world  and  saying,  “This  is  me,  this  is  my   
business.”   
_**A: The  problem  is  that  I  started  with  three  things  I  meant  to do at  the  same  time **_  
_**and  that  is  not  sustainable  because  I’m  not  doing  any of  the  three  well  enough   
just because… **_  
Correct.  So  we’re  going  to  kill  two  and  you’re  going  to  be  stuck  with  one.  And   
that’s  sad, but true.   
**What do you want to do all day? **  
Let’s talk  about  the difference between  the structure  of  your  business  and  what your   
business  does.   
If  you  are  peripatetic  and  you  need  to  be  constantly  shifting  from one  thing  to   
another,  one  ought  to  build  a  business  that  rewards  that.  As  opposed  to  say,  “I  have   
to  be  a  massage  therapist  for  eight  hours  a  day.”   
The  person  who  wants  to  be  a  massage  therapist  for  eight  hours  a  day  doesn’t   
worry  about  becoming  bored  with  it.   
On  the  other  hand,  Dick  Cavett’s  business  was,  “I’m a  talk  show  host,  but  every   
day there is a  different  person to talk  to.”  It’s less likely he’s going to get  bored if the  
business  is  going  well  because  there’s  someone  interesting  coming  in  tomorrow.   
For  me,  I  had  70  people  working  for  me.  What  I  discovered  was  I  don’t  like   
having  70  people  working  for  me.  It  was  too  much  responsibility.  I was  taking care  
of  too  many  people.  It  kept  me  from taking  the  risks  that  get  me  out  of  bed  in  the   
morning.   
So  I  rebuilt  my  life  so  I  have  no  people  working  for  me.  And  at  Squidoo  they  work   
for  the  company;  I  just  bother  them.  Now  it  matches  my  personality.    
If  I  want  to  make  a  record  album one  day  and  do  a  book  three  months  later,  I  can.   
I’m still  doing  my  job  which  is  this  thing  I’m doing  right  here.  But  I’m never  going  to   
do this event  again—never  going to do it with you in this place. This is a once in a   
lifetime  thing  for  me.  Almost  everyday  I  do  a  once  in  a  lifetime  thing.   
There  are  other  people  who  keep  doing  the  same  thing  every  day  because  that’s   
who  they  are. This  has  nothing to  do  with  your  business  strategy, it has  to  do  with   
what do  you want  to do all day?

**PERMISSION AND TRUST**   
**The  Lifetime  Value  of  a  Customer **  
If  you can live on those people, that’s  enough. That’s  what a raw food  juice bar  in a  
low  rent  district  can  do.  On  the  other  hand  if  you  say,  “No,  I  need  5  million   
vegetarians so I can get  Kraft  as a sponsor,”  that  tribe isn’t  who you should start   
with. What  will  make  that  tribe  happy  will  never  make  5  million  vegetarians  and   
Kraft happy.    
Figuring  out  how  to  get  from where  you  start  to  where you need to be is critical.  
If  there  is  no  path,  there’s  something  wrong  with  your  business.   
That  goes all  the way back  to,  where  do  you  want  to  build  your  property?  And   
how  much  does  it  cost  you  to  get  a  vegetarian  and  how  much  is  a  vegetarian  worth?   
Because  the  question  after  how  much  does  it  cost  to  make  a  sale  is,  what’s  the   
lifetime  value  of  a  sale?  So  let’s  talk  about this.   
How  many  pairs  of  shoes  do  you  own  Chris?  Five,  and  they  cost  $90  each.  Chris  is   
worth  $450  to  this  little  shop  in  Oregon.  Not  every  one  of  their  customers  is  worth   
$450, but  Chris is.   
If  you  make  a  product  people  only  need  to  buy  once  in  their whole life,  it’s very  
different  than  if  you  make  a  product  people  are  going  to  use  everyday  forever.   
How  much  is  Starbucks  willing  to  spend  to  get  someone  addicted  to  espresso?   
The answer is probably $100. They’re probably willing to spend $100 on real  estate  
to  get  one  person  hooked  because  their  lifetime  value  is  $500.  See  that?   
When  someone  is  competing  with  Starbucks,  they  say,  “It’s  not  fair.  The  rent  is   
too  high.”  Starbucks  says,  “No,  no,  no.  The  rent  is  not  too  high  because  I’m creating   
1,000 addicts  every  time  I  put  in  a  new  facility.”  They’re  taking  the  correct  view  in  a   
competitive  market.   
If  you’re  Henry  Lewis  and  you’re  building  a  weekly  news  magazine,  how  much   
are  you  willing  to  spend  to  get  one  new  subscriber  to  Time  magazine?  You  do  the   
math.  Well  you  say,  “If  someone  subscribes  for  six  years  and  doing  the  math  of  40   
ads  per  issue,  50  issues  a  year,  five  years,  blah,  blah,  blah,  each  subscriber  to  Time   
magazine  is  worth  $200  to  me.”   
So  if  someone  comes  to  you  and  says,  “Buy  TV  ads  to  get  new  subscribers  to  
Time,”  and  the  ads  are  $150-­‐$200,  you  buy  them because  you  make  a  profit.  It’s  all   
built  into  the  structure  and  how  you  maximize  the  lifetime  value  of  someone  who’s   
expensive to reach.   
For  example,  for  someone  in  Kit’s  case  there  is  not  a  lot  of repeat  business  
because  first  you  have  to  come  back  to  Miami  as  a  tourist.  Secondly,  you  have  to

want  to  do  it  again.  Most  of  the  value  she  is  going  to  create  is  going  to  come  from  
that first interaction. On the  other  hand, if  it’s  fabulous  that person is likely to tell   
their  friends  when  they  go  home.  Suddenly  the  cost  of  marketing  goes  down  because   
people are telling one another.   
**Making it  Work **  
Two  things  are  happening  and  I  want  to  call  them out.  If  they’re  not  happening  to   
you, that’s fabulous.    
Thing  number  one  is,  some  of  you  are  saying,  “How  do  I  make  all  of  what  I’ve   
learned  this  morning  work  for  the  structure  of  the  business  I’m already  committed   
to?”  And  the  parts  that  don’t  work,  you’re  ignoring.   
And  some  of  you  are  saying,  “This  is  a  vast  untapped  territory. I have no chance  
of  succeeding.  I’m never  going  to  get  it  right.  I  surrender.”   
Both  of  them are  the  wrong  responses.  Let’s  take  them one  at  a  time.   
Entrepreneurs  by their  nature are willful, strong willed, bull headed, and   
committed.  If  we’re  not,  we  fail.  But  sometimes  we  get  hung  up  on  getting  confused   
between sticking with  the  right path  and  sticking with  the  wrong path.   
The person who insists on pushing their independent  bookstore—“Independent  
bookstore!  Independent bookstore!”—in the face of what’s happening in the world  
isn’t  a  persistent  entrepreneur. They’re a  fool.    
They say, “I got  to figure out  how  to sell  eBooks.”  No, you’re never going to be  
able  to  sell eBooks  in your  independent bookstore. Don’t try. There’s  a lot of  things  
you can do in your independent  bookstore, but  falling in love with the archetype or  
the  vision you have  in your  head  is  not the  way  to  do  it.    
If  all  you’ve  taken  away  from the  last  four  hours  is  that  these  things  are   
interesting on the side, but  I got  to  stick  with  making  better  Thai  food,  you’ve   
completely  missed  the  point.   
The  more  degrees  of  freedom you  introduce  over  the  next  few  hours,  then  you’ll   
lock  them back  in,  the  more  likely  it  is  you  are  going  to  build  a  business  that  works.   
I’m going  to  give  you  more  and  more  examples  of  how  that  happens  because  I   
only have a  couple of these questions left. You’re going to need to feel  the texture of  
the  examples  to  see  how  this  works  in  the  connection  economy,  which  doesn’t   
necessarily  mean  on  the  net.  It  just  means  that’s  what  we’re  valuing  now.   
The  second  group  of  you  and  I  can  see  it  in  your  eyes  is  saying,  “Ah,  it’s  possible   
to  build  the  perfect  entrepreneurial  project.  I  can’t  because  I  don’t  see  it.”  And  you   
have to start  before you see the end.    
   
46   

* * *

   
   
There’s no way to do this without  starting before you see the end. You build the  
fundamental  building  blocks.  You  put  them in  place  so  that  every  day  success  leads   
to  more  success.  It  will  get  you  somewhere,  but  where  you’re  trying  to  go  isn’t  what   
you’re going to have the first  day.    
It’s  more  about,   
**“Did  this  interaction  permit me  to  survive? Can  I  keep   
piling  on  these  interactions  one  after  another  so that **  
**it becomes  a  virtuous  cycle  along  the  way?” **  
**1,000 True  Fans **  
Mark  asked  about  my  blog.  I  talk  about  blogs  a lot because  it’s  good  for  the  soul, but  
it’s also an extraordinarily inexpensive low  risk  tribe-­‐building  tool.  If  you  commit  to   
writing  something  for  your  tribe,  not  about  you,  but  for  your  tribe  everyday,  over   
time  you  will  increase  the  footprint  you have with your tribe and the trust  your tribe  
gives  you.  And  it’s  free.   
Those people will  e-­‐mail  you  and  you  will  find  out  what  they’re  thinking,  which   
is free. Then these interactions will  scale which is free.    
At  some  point  you’ll  decide  you  hate  these people and you  should shut  it  down  
or you’ll  decide you want  to do for these people, be with these people, and leverage  
these  people.  In  which  case,  the  business  ideas  will  just  come  to  you.  They’ll  just   
keep  presenting  themselves  over,  over,  and  over  again.    
If  you  look  at  Boing  Boing,  one  of  the  most  popular  blogs  ever,  their  business   
model  is  a  little  flaky.  They  make  some  money  on  advertising,  but  basically  Cory,   
Mark,  and  Xeni  have  all  these  doors  open  to  them because  there  is  a  million  mutants   
on earth  who  trust  them.  A million  people  who  if  they  say,  “I’m writing  a  new  book,”   
will  go  buy  it.  A million  people  who  if  they  say,  “I’m going  to  be  in  New  York,  come  to   
this  meeting  I’m doing,”  will  come.   
Kevin Kelly  calls  these  people  the  1,000  true  fans. If there are 1,000 people who  
will fly  to  Hastings  and  spend  three  days  with  you, you never  have  to  look for  work  
for the rest  of your life. You’re done. 1,000 people, that’s all  it  takes.    
I’m not  patient  with  folks  who  say  it  has  to  be  perfect  and  proven, and then I’ll  do  
it.  It  will  never  be  perfect  and  it  will  never  be  proven.  All  I  can  keep  doing  is  piling   
up  the  examples  and  then  interact  with  you  as  we  talk  about  this.   
You’re  going  to  need  to  think  really  hard  about,  what  story  do  you  want  someone   
who  _hears_ you to tell?   
If  I  said  to  you,  “Tell  someone  who’s  never  experienced  it  what  Nike  products  are   
like,”  and  you  talked  about  Nike,  most  of  you  would  say  something  that  would  make

Phil  Knight  happy.  Same  thing  with  Harley  Davidson,  an  iconic  brand  that has  a  
monopoly  on  what  it  stands  for.   
But,  if  I  said,  “Tell  the  person  next  to  you  about  Delta  Airlines.”  Even  though   
Delta  Airlines  spends  millions  of  dollars  a  year  on  something  they  call  marketing,   
you’d  all  say  something  different  based  on  some  random personal  experience.  They   
could  pretend  they  have  some  slogan.  They  could  pretend  they  have  some  integrity.   
But  they  have  no  connection.  No  one,  other  than  a  frequent  flier  mile  holder,  would   
miss  Delta  if  they  went  out  of  business  and  it  was  replaced by a  different  airline. No  
one  would  miss  them.   
**The  key  to  what  you’re  building  is,  can  you build  
something  that  would  be  missed  if  it  were  gone? Can   
you  become the speaker,  impresario,  connector,  or  
software  developer  that  if  you  weren’t  there,  we’d   
have to  hassle before we found  someone who  could **  
**do it? **  
**Focusing on  What You Can  Do **  
Now, I  just  want  to go through the last  two questions, which aren’t  nearly as  
important  in  the  beginning.   
One,  how  do  I  make  what  I’m making  significantly  more  cheaply?   
In the  case  of  somebody  who  wants  to  run  a  successful  bar  and  grill,  if  the  scarce   
thing  they  offer  is  a  great  environment  to  drink  whisky  and  beer  and  they’re   
spending  a  fortune  making  chicken  sandwiches,  they  could  probably  spend  less   
money  making  chicken  sandwiches  and  still have  the  place  be  what they need  it to   
be.    
One  of  the  things  to  think about as  we’re  starting these  things  is  what have  you  
built  into  your  assumptions  that  are  going  to  make  it  hard  and  expensive  that  you   
can  skip  and  still  make  it  scarce  and  valuable?   
One  of  the  ways  to  do  that  is  by  using  off  the  shelf  software.  Lots  of  times  people   
say,  “I  have  to  build  this  perfect  piece  of  software  to  make  everything  work,”  when   
in  fact,  maybe  you  don’t  have  to  do  anything  of  this  sort.  Maybe  you  just build these  
things  in  keynote,  export  them to  the  iPad,  and  they  work.  You  haven’t  spent  a   
penny  on  development.   
Can  I  do it  faster?   
Can  I  figure  out  how  to  interact  with  people  that  gives  me  more  alacrity?   
   
48   

* * *

   
   
One  of  the  big advantages  you have  of  being  small  and  being  new  is  you  don’t   
have  a  committee  and  you  don’t  have  processes.  It’s  just  you.  Sometimes  that’s  a   
disadvantage,  but  lots  of  times  that’s  an  advantage.   
When  I  was  book  packager  and  it  was  just  me,  I  was  able  to  get  a  book  from an   
idea  to done  in  five  days.  A lot  of  the  people  we  were  working  with  couldn’t  even   
have  a  meeting  about  doing  something  in  five  days  and  we  were  done.  Not  every   
customer  wants  that.  But  that’s  an  interesting  place  for  you  to  start.   
**Start  with people who  value the thing  you  _can  do_****  as **  
**opposed to pretending  to be  someone  else. **  
**Launching is Overrated **  
Then  we’re  going  to  spend  a  lot  of  time  talking  about  shipping.  It’s  so  easy  to   
become  paralyzed  in  the  pursuit  of  perfect  that  you  end  up  not  being  good.  You’re  so   
worried  about launching in this  spectacular  way, so  you never  do.    
I think launching in the  connection  economy  is  way  overrated.  It’s  not  important   
at all. The  big gala, the  large  book signing, and  the  press  releases—all on the  first  
day—it  doesn’t  matter  anymore.  The  media  you  were  trying  to  put  that  show  on  for   
is gone.    
What  matters  is  you  didn’t  start  using  Gmail  until  it’s  been  out  for  a  year.   
You  didn’t  start  subscribing  to  that  magazine  until  it’s  been  in  business  40  years.   
You didn’t start going out for  Starbucks  coffee  until it’s  been there  for  years.    
This  idea  that  the  first  day  everyone  has  to  come  isn’t  what’s  going  to  happen.   
What’s  going to  happen is  a few people  are  going to  interact with  you enough   
that they  understand  the  value, they  trust you to  deliver  the  value, and  they  pay  you  
for it.   
**Permission  Marketing **  
A friend  of  mine  named  Dany  started  a  business  called  Daily  Candy.  The  deal  is  if   
you’re  a  woman,  into  fashion,  and  live  in  one  of  ten  metropolitan  areas,  all  I  want   
from you  is  your  e-­‐mail  address.  That’s  all  I  want.   
Everyday, for  the rest  of  your  life,  I’m going  to  send  you  an  e-­‐mail  with  nice   
illustrations  telling  you  something  cool  that’s  happening  in  your  city.  Prada  is  having   
a  sample  sale,  there  is  a  cool  party  going  on  in  this  bar,  they  just  opened  this  new   
Loehmann’s  branch,  whatever.    
She ran this for  a few years, sent out an e-­‐mail  everyday  and  she  and  Bob   
Pittman  sold  it  to  Comcast  for  $125  million.  Now,  I’m not  saying  money  is  the  only   
point  here.  What  I’m saying  is  what  did  she  create  that’s  valuable?   
   
49   

* * *

   
   
What  she  had  was  permission  and  trust  of  a  few  people.  Not  a  lot.  Just  a  million.   
Only 1  out of  300  people  in the  country.    
They said if your e-­‐mail  doesn’t  show  up  everyday,  I’m going  to  complain.  I’m  
waiting everyday  patiently  for  your  e-­‐mail  to  show  up.  If  it’s  not  here,  I’m going to  
miss  it.  And  two,  if  you  tell  me  about  something,  I’m more  likely  to  try  it.   
If  you  said,  “I  want  to  figure  out  how  to  get  the  largest  possible  number  of  right   
people in Charlotte to get an e-­‐mail  from me  three  times  a  week.  All  I’m going  to   
send them is  a  video  I’m going  to  make  of  me  interviewing  someone  from a  different   
non-­‐profit,  three  times  a  week.  It’s  only  three  minutes  long  about  why  they  are   
amazing.”  Drip,  drip,  drip.   
Over  time  if  you  get  a  video  that  resonates  with  you,  you  can  forward  it to  all  
your  friends.  You  can’t  do  that  with  a  website.  Drip,  drip,  drip.  The  number  of  people   
who  are  subscribing goes  up.    
So now if you call up a nonprofit, and say “Hi, I want to feature you in this e-­‐mail   
that I send  out to  12,000  people everyday, and  oh  by  the  way  I  know  you  get  it.  I’m  
going  to  produce  it,  and  by  the  way  you  know  how  good  my  videos  are  because   
you’ve  seen  them.  Can  I  come?”  They’ll  say,  “Can  you  be  here  in  an  hour.”  Why   
wouldn’t they?   
**The  asset  you are  building  that  you can  point  to  is  not   
a website  that  is  hard  to  change.  It’s  a Mailchimp  e-­**  
**mail  list  that  everyday  gets  more  valuable. **  
It  will  never  get  less  valuable.  See  what  I’m getting  at?   
Then  the  success  stories  that  get  created  are  simple.  I’m going  to  show  you  an   
example.   
When you get a chance, everyone clap your  hands  just once really loud  _\[mostly in _  
_sync  claps\]_  Ah.  You’re  too  good.  You’re  in  sync.  All  right,  this  time  we’re  going  to  do  it   
all  at  the  same  time.  One,  two,  three  _\[perfectly in  sync  claps\]._  The difference is   
significant.  When  there  are  lots  of  little  claps,  it  doesn’t  count  for  very  much.  But  if   
everyone  claps  at  the  same  time,  we  notice  it.   
So  you  become  this  power  broker.  Because  you’ll  be  able  to  say,  “I’ve  got  these   
15,000  people who are nascent volunteers  or  nascent philanthropists and you are  
the  next one  I pick.” Then you can go  to  charities  and  say, “You know, I picked  you  
and  you  didn’t  convert,  so  I’m not  going  to  pick  you  anymore.”  But  we  learned   
something.  When  we  did  this  story  and  the  conversion  was  easier  to  do, a whole   
bunch  of  people  went and  did  it.

Kickstarter  was  started  to  say  there’s  all these  projects  that would  get done  if  we   
knew  in  advance  that  people  were  going  to  buy  it.  “I  want  to  make  a  record  album,  if   
I  just  knew  1,000  of  my  fans  were  going  to  buy  it,  I  could  easily  have  the  confidence   
to  make  it.  And  if  you  all  put  $10  up  front,  I  can  actually  walk  into  the  recording   
studio. We’re done.”   
Kickstarter  said,  “Here’s  a  platform.  It’s  very  simple.  Go to your  fans  and  say this   
is  what  I’ll  make  if  you  put  up  enough  money  and  if  you  don’t  you  get  your  money   
back.    
  Once  again,  people  on  the  Internet  confuse  the  mechanics  to  do  something  and   
what  actually  makes  it  work.  Kickstarter  is  irrelevant.  If  you have an audience you  
can reach, you can do it  without  Kickstarter. There are all  these Kickstarter clones.  
Kickstarter  adds  almost  no  value  to  someone  who  has  an  audience.   
My  book,  the  Icarus  Deception,  I  did  it  on  Kickstarter.  For  my  book,  4%  of  the   
money  that  came  in  came  from Kickstarter.  96%  came  from people  I  sent  to   
Kickstarter.  So  it’s  not  like  Kickstarter  has  this  community  of  eager  philanthropists.   
Kickstarter  just  has  a  piece  of  software  that  let’s  me  adjudicate  demand  with  supply.   
This really  different  than  Casey  Kasem or  Clive  Davis.  Casey  Kasem goes  to  all   
these  radio  stations  and  says, “Every  week I will give  you a two  hour  radio  show.  
We’ll  split  the  commercials.  Half  the  commercials  you’ll  sell.  Half  the  commercials  I’ll   
sell. Everybody wins.”  For  years,  years,  and  years,  Casey  made  millions  of  dollars   
making  a  radio  show.  Who  has  the  power?  The  musician  or  Casey?   
The answer is Casey has the power.    
Why  does  Casey  have  the  power? Because  Casey  has  a relationship with  the   
radio stations and the radio stations have a relationship with the listeners. So if  
Casey  wants  to  make  you  famous,  he  can,  and  if  you  want  to  pay  him a  gratuity,   
that’s  fine, but the  artist has  no  power  whatsoever.    
Kickstarter  says  “Whoa,  whoa,  whoa.  As  an  artist  you  already have a  relationship   
with  your  reader, listener, or  fan. We  will let you go  straight to  that person leaving  
Casey  Kasem,  Clive  Davis,  and  Sunny  Madha  out  of  the  equation  because  you  can   
publish yourself.”    
Artists  hate  this.  They  don’t  like  having  to  keep  track  of  all  these  fans.  They  don’t   
like  having  to  collect  all  these  addresses.  They  don’t  like  people  complaining  the   
statue  of  the  Icarus  is  fuzzy  on  the  book  cover.  They  just  want  to  make  their  work.   
If  someone  came  forward  and  said,  “I’m the  Casey  Kasem of  big  thinkers  and  my   
first  project  is Clay Shirky’s new  book. I  will  keep  you  posted on how  Clay is doing.  
Clay is in  the video,  so you  know  he and I  are doing  it  together.”  Everyone would  
think that would be great.   
   
51   

* * *

   
   
You and  Clay have  their  e-­‐mail  addresses  in  this  file.  If  you  e-­‐mail  everybody  a   
month  later  and  say,  “I’m back  again.  Remember  I  brought  you  Clay  last  month.  This   
month  I’m bringing  you  Jeff  Jarvis.”   
Some  people  are  going  to  be  annoyed  and  think, “No, no, no, I signed  up for  Clay.”  
That’s  what  permission  is,  keeping  promises.  But  if  you  were  clear  up  front,  they  get   
Casey’s  new  job.  Kate  is  the  impresario  of  big  thinkers  monetizing  their  work  for   
their  fans.   
With  each  person you get the  new  big thinker’s  e-­‐mail  list  where  he’s  going  to   
alert  them via  his  blog  or  she’s  going  to  alert  them via  twitter.  Plus  you  get  your  back   
asset of  all the  people  who  have  funded  your  previous  project. Who  does  this  sound   
like?  Bill  Graham.   
Bill  Graham presents is exactly it. He owned Winterland, but he also rented the  
Cow  Palace.  He  could  find  a  venue  any  time  you  wanted  to.  But  no  one  ever  came  to   
hear  Bill  Graham perform because  he  had  no  talent.  They  came  to  hear  The  Dead.   
They  came  to  hear  Jefferson  Starship. What  Bill  built  were these networks of  
relationships and you  knew  if Bill  was going  to break  a  new  act,  it  was probably  
worth  going to.   
There  is  a  huge  vacuum of  impresarios.  We  need  Bill  Graham.  But  he’s  dead.  So   
where  does  the  next  Bill  Graham exist. He  or  she  is  the  person that is  the  broker  of   
trust,  attention,  and  talent  and  building  a  bridge  between  them.   
Amanda  Palmer,  who’s  wonderful,  is  not  going  to  make  a  lot  of  money  on  her   
record  and  she’s  having  a  nervous  breakdown.  She  put  herself  completely into this  
thing  and  then  when  she’s  done  and  goes  to  recover,  that  asset  is  going  to  waste.  All  
those  people, 100,000  of  them  that paid  on average $12, they’re just going to waste.    
Whereas  if  she  had  a  trusted  partner  who  could  find  the  next  Amanda  Palmer   
and  handle  all this  craziness, you can do  it again.    
That’s  what  I’m talking  about.  That  asset  dramatically  cuts  the  cost  of  customer   
acquisition  and  dramatically  increases  speed  to  market  and  trust.   
**Productivity and Tribes **  
Here’s what  people in  business will  always pay for. If an individual  is paying X  to get   
Y  and  you  can  prove  to  them they  can  get  2Y  for  the  same  amount  of  X,  they’ll  try  it.   
That’s  not  often  something  you  can  promise.  But  if  you  can  promise  it  and  deliver  on   
it, then there will  be a  line out  the door.    
If  you’re  a  sales  trainer  for  example,  and  the  people  who  graduate  from your   
sales  class  close  twice  as  many  sales  because  it’s  that  good,  you’re  not  going  to  have   
any  trouble  over  time  growing  your  business.  Because  they  are  already  measuring   
things  on  this  axis  and  you  just  took  them from here  to  here.  You  didn’t  give  them a   
   
52

new  thing  to  measure.  You  just  said  you’re  going  to  get  more  of  that  thing  you’re   
paying for  in a very trustworthy way.    
That’s really different  than saying, “I’m going  to  charge  you  something  you’re  not   
used  to paying for.”    
Productivity  is  about  getting  more  for  the  amount  invested.  You  need  to  say,   
“What  are  people  paying  for  and  can  I  dramatically  increase  it?”   
If  it’s  presentation coaching, I would  say something like this, “Which group of  
people has  a very high stakes  presentation that I can reach who share a worldview  
and  understand  paying  for  stuff  is  worth  it  if  it  makes  things  get  better?”  That’s  a   
tiny  fraction of  the  actual people  who  give  presentations.    
The  second  thing,  there  probably  is  not  going  to  be  a  repeat  customer  if  all  I’m  
doing  is  teaching  them how  to  make  a  presentation.  Which  means,  I  need  to  charge  a   
lot  for  it  or  I  have  to  do  the  whole  organization.  Or,  “I’m not  going  to  teach  them,  I’m  
going  to  do  it  for  them.”  And  that’s  what  Nancy  Duarte  does.   
Nancy  Duarte  says,  “Every  time  you  need  to  do  a  presentation,  send  me  your  bad   
slides,  send  me  your  notes,  I  will  send  you  back  better  slides  with  better  notes.”  And   
if you are CEO, work  for a  CEO or  do big presentations, etc., she can charge you  
$10,000 a presentation because it’s worth it. _\[I  have no  idea  what  she really charges, _  
_but  let’s  just  say.\]_   
Over  time  because  she’s  generous,  she  writes  books  about  it,  she  trains  about  it,   
etc., because  she’d  love  to  teach  a  man  to  fish.  But  the  core  of  the  business  is,  “Can  I   
be  a  service  business  for  this  incredibly  important  thing  that  no  one’s  ever  paid  to   
buy  before?”  She  understands  the  vast  majority  of  people  will  never  hire  her  to  do  a   
presentation,  which  is  fine  with  her.  She  just  wants  some  people.   
The answer to your question is not, “How  do I persuade everyone to pay for this  
thing they’re  not used  to  paying for?”   
  It’s, “How do I find  the few people who are eager to pay for it?”

**RAISING  MONEY**   
**Owning Your  Channel **  
If  we think about the worldview of  the person who buys  a TV  ad, are they an  
innovator?  Are  they  an  early  adopter  about  the  format  of  TV  advertising?   
They’re laggards. They’re the least  innovative people in the world. They  buy 30   
second  slots.  It’s  not  their  job  to  invent  a  new  kind  of  TV  commercial.  The  person   
who  invents  a  new  kind  of  TV  commercial  isn’t  in  the  room and  you  don’t  get  to  call   
on that  person.   
If  you want to go talk to the person who is  in charge of  buying new  TV  
commercials—there’s  like  one  person at Zenith  who  does  this, and  one  person at  
DDBA,  etc.  who  does  it—that person will buy  $100,000  worth  as  a test and  they  will  
never  buy  from you  again  because  their  job  is  to  buy  the  new  thing.  You  can’t  build  a   
business on that.   
What you’ve  done  is  you’ve  looked  at this  industry  you’re  in that you really  like,  
you’ve  made  a  list  of  everything  that’s  broken  about  it,  and  you’re  saying,  “I’m going   
to  fix the  whole  thing. This  is  how it should  be.”    
But if  you don’t have  $100  million,  you  can’t  get  from here  to  there  in  a  straight   
line. Instead, what you have  to  do  is  say, “What _one_  asset can I build  that I  can  afford   
to  build?  And  once  I  build  that  asset,  how  can  I  take  that  to  teach  TV  a  lesson?”   
Remember  when  Kevin  Rose  from Digg  started  that  little  TV  show  he  had?—Digg   
is  like  that  online  service  like  Reddit.  Kevin  is  not  really  a  businessman,  but  he  loves   
inventing new  stuff. Because Digg was really popular, he started a  TV show. It  was  
an  hour  a  week  of  him and  his friend drinking beers and talking about  the Internet.  
It  had  over  100,000  viewers  every  week.  As  you  know  of  ratings,  it  would  not  have   
put it at the top, but not getting canceled  off  the cable network either. He was  in  
charge of the whole thing. If he had  stuck with  it, he  could  have  gone  to  a 500,000   
viewers  for  a  TV  show  he  made  for  free  where  he  was  100%  in  charge  and  every   
week he  knew he  could  go  straight to  everybody.   
If  you had  500,000  viewers, you could  start changing rules. Because when the  
phone  rang  and  somebody  said,  “I  want  to  sponsor  your  show  Luke.”  You  could  say,   
“Great,  but  the  ad’s  only  four  seconds  long.”  You  have  something—a  monopoly  on   
the  attention  of  these  500,000  people.  See  what  I’m getting  at?   
The asset  that  underlies television  has  changed. It used  to be the FCC  gave you a  
channel. 2,4, 7, and 29 when I was growing up in Buffalo—that’s  it. If  you had  the   
channel,  you  made  money.  If  you  didn’t  have  the  channel,  you  didn’t  have  a  channel.   
Then  cable  came  along  and  said  instead  of  three  channels  in  a  community,   
there’s  a  175.  Some  people  like  Ted  Turner  totally  understood  this.  Ted  is  a   
billionaire  for  one  reason.  He  said,  “I’ll  take  as  many  channels  as  I  can  get.”  That’s  it.   
   
54   

* * *

   
   
Whereas  ABC  and  CBS  said,  “We  don’t  understand  cable.  We’re threatened by it.  
We  won’t  do  very  much  at  all  other  than  ESPN  and  one  or  two  others.”  That’s  why   
they  didn’t grab channels. Ted  saw an asset up for  grabs  and  he  grabbed  it.    
**The  Long Tail **  
Now  cable is going away. There aren’t  150 channels, there’s a  150  million   
channels—the  long tail.    
What we  know is  that there  are  hits—that if  I look at book sales, TV  shows, video   
rentals,  etc.,  this is top  ten,  that  these are sales of the next  ten,  and pretty quickly the  
sales  go  to  really  low  numbers  for  each  title.    
Back when there  were  only 12  radio  stations  in a town, you only got to  listen to   
those.  The  long  tail  didn’t  exist  because  they  said,  “Jamaican  polka  music,  we’re  not   
going to put that on the air.” This is called the short head. This is Hitsville—  
American  top  40,  the  New  York  Times  bestseller  list,  and  the  people  who  are   
watching  the  number  one  shows.   
Then  they  invent  the  Internet  and  the  Internet  says,  “We  have  an  unlimited   
amount  of  inventory.”   
If  I  look  at  the  sales  of  Barnes  and  Nobles  versus  Amazon, what  I see is that   
Amazon  gets  half  their  sales  in  dollars  from books  that  Barnes  and  Nobles  has  never   
carried.    
iTunes  gets  half  their  revenue  from music  that  has  never  once  been  sold  in  a   
store.    
Netflix  gets their half their viewers for stuff that  has  never  been in a Blockbuster.  
Half,  for this whole section  here,  the long  tail,  that’s half.   
What we’re  seeing with  TV  is  they  just opened  up YouTube, Netflix, iTunes  and   
other things—“This  real  estate,  it’s  for  sale,  who  wants  it?”  Some  people  like  Netflix  
say,  “I  do,”  and  they  take  all  of  it.  That’s  how  you  make  money  on  the  long  tail.   
Amazon  says,  “I  will  sell  every  book  and  that’s  not  enough,  anyone  who  wants  to   
put it on the Kindle, fine.” So now the tail goes  out there. Most Kindle titles  have sold   
one  copy  because  you  can  make  a  Kindle  title  for  free.  You  read  it.  No  one  ever  else   
will  because  it’s  way  out  here  on  the  long  tail.  Amazon  doesn’t  care  because  they   
own all  of it.    
YouTube  owns  all  of  it.  When  you  say  you  want  to  make  a  TV  channel,  I  worry  
because  I  say,  “Are  you  trying  to  go  up  against  people  who  are  desperate  to  maintain   
their  spot on the  short head? Or  is  he  talking about owning a tiny  slice  of  the  long-­‐  
tail?”   
   
55   

* * *

   
   
You  can  make  money  owning  a  tiny  slice  of  the  long-­‐tail _if_ that  slice  is  the  Annals   
of  the  Biomedical  Neurosurgeon  Association—100 people watching your video, but   
the  pharmaceutical  company  will  pay  you  a  million  dollars  a  month  to  sponsor  you.   
That’s  very  different  than  Garden  Tractor  monthly  which  is  a  video  that gets   
seen  by  10  farmers  and  you’re  never  going  to  make  a  penny.   
The scarce thing is attention and trust. If you built  a  channel  that  had attention  
and  trust, everything else  will take  care  of  itself. Now you have  to  decide  what’s  the   
best way  to  go  from nothing  to  attention  and  trust?   
The easiest  way to do it  is understanding the long-­‐tail  does  not  reward  mass   
culture.  It  rewards  indispensable  micro  culture.   
If  you’ve  made  a  channel  about  tattoos,  people  who  are  into  tattoos  could  not   
live  without you.   
If  you  make  a  channel  that  is  sort  of  a  variation  of  the  Jersey  Shore,  we’ve  got  lots   
of alternatives. You can’t  possibly crowd our attention and grab  it.    
The secret  is,    
**“How  do  I  get  to  a  micro  group  that  is  eager  to  hear   
from  me  and  will either  pay  me with  attention  or  
money  and  do  it  in  a  way  that  keeps  me  afloat  enough **  
**so  I  can  do  it  again,  again  and  again?” **  
Once  you have  1,000  channels, each  of  which  is  watched  regularly by 100,000  
people, and  you have one  hundred  million  with  duplication  viewership, suddenly  
you’ve  done  something  really  interesting.   
Now, you  can dictate to producers what  kind of shows you  want  and to  
advertisers  what kind  of  ads  you want to  run because  you did  the  hard  part. You’ve   
found viewers.   
**Laying the  Foundation **  
What you want  to  do  when  you’re  asking  someone  for  actual  advice  as  opposed  to   
just approval is you want to expose the weakest part of what you’re doing and say it  
as  clearly as  you can.    
Back to  the  architect in the  building.    
If  you’re going to bring in a structural  engineer  and  say, “Is  this  building going to  
withstand  an earthquake,” you want to  do  it before  you put up all the  bricks  and   
before  you paint the  drywall. Because  the  structural engineer  doesn’t care  about  
how  fancy you painted the drywall. They don’t  care about  you’re excuses about  why  
   
56

you’re  using  this  kind  of  timber  instead  of  that  kind  of  timber.  You  need  to  say,  “That   
joint  over  there,  I’m really  worried  about  this,  can  that  joint  be  better?”   
It’s  only in the early stages  of  architecting your  business that  you  get  to have  
these  conversations  because  otherwise  you’ve  invested  too  much  and  you’re  going   
to  say, “Don’t look at that. That’ll be  fine.”    
Be  as  clear  as  you  can  when  you’re  talking  to  us  and  say,  “This  is  my  business.   
This  is  my  goal.  This  is  my  timeline.  This  is  the  money  I  have.  And  this  is  why  it’s   
going to work,” and layout the foundational structure of it.    
Not  why you’re doing it. I  don’t  care why you’re doing it. I  care why I  want  to buy  
it. I care why I want  to be part  of it.    
**Everyone  is  selfish. Even  the  people  who  like  you  are   
selfish  because  they  like  liking  you. That’s  why   
they’re  rooting  for  you,  not because  they’re  actually   
rooting for you,  but  because rooting for you  make **  
_**them**_**  feel  good.  **  
We  just  have  to  keep  coming  back  to  that.   
**Raising Money **  
The  other  thing  that  I  need  to  talk  about  is  raising  money.   
Anyone  who  is  going  to  invest  in  you  would  like  the  money  back.  The  question  is,   
how  are  you  going  to  give  them the  money  back?  And  there  are  only a few choices.    
The  most  popular  choice  is  you  give  that  person  stock  in  your  company.   
Generally,  it  means  they  own  part  of  your  company.  Well  if  they  own  part  of  your   
company,  how  are  they  going  to  get  the  money  back?  The  only  way  is  for  you  to  sell   
it.    
A traditional  investment  deal,  the  Silicon  Valley  type  thing,  means  you’ve  already   
promised  you’re  going  to  sell  your  company  as  fast  as  you  can.  If  that’s  not  your  goal,   
don’t  raise  money  that  way.  If  you  do,  there’s  going  to  be  this  friction  that’s  going to   
start  really soon. The investor is getting graded on, “How  soon does she bring  
money  back”  and  you  are  saying,  “I  want  to  do  this  for  the  rest  of  my  life,  I’m never   
selling  this  company.”  Someone  is  going  to  wind  up  unhappy.   
The other way to pay  people  back,  particularly  if  you’re  not  some  fancy  Silicon   
Valley  company  is  you  go  to  the  investor  and  say,  “Look  I’m putting  on  a  show  (the   
show  can be whatever, it  can be a  traditional  kind of show  or it  could be a  coffee  
shop) and for the first  six  months  all  the  profits  are  yours,  but  after  that,  the  amount   
of  profits  I  give  you  go  down  until  I’ve  paid  you  back  all  your  money  plus  this  much.   
   
57   

* * *

   
   
So  you  own  a  piece  of  it,  but  then  over  time  the  piece  gets  lower  and  lower  because   
I’m paying  you  back  via  the  proceeds.”    
Let’s say before Kickstarter you  wanted to rent  the Tarrytown  Music Hall  and  
put  on  ballet  performance.  The  theater  cost  $6,000  to  rent.  The  ballerinas  get  paid   
$3,000.  So  you  need  $9,000.  You  go  to  the  investor  and  say,  “Give  me  the  $9,000  to  
put on this  show and  the first $18,000  in the door  is  yours  and  then we’re even.”    
If  you  end  up  making  $50,000,  you  get  to  keep  the  rest.  And  if  you  make  $16,000,   
he gets back  his $16,000. He didn’t  get  the full  $18,000. You get  zero, but  it  didn’t   
cost  you  anything  either.  So  you’re  selling  future  cash  flow  from this  thing  that  you   
are  building.   
A bank  is  never  going  to  do  that  deal,  but  your  mother-­‐in-­‐law  might  and  it   
completely  eliminates  all  that  weird  family  friction  of,  “Well  they’re  still  my  partner   
and  I’m never  going  to  be  able  to  get  rid  of  them.”   
I hate to say it, but    
**One  of  the  goals  when you’re  raising money  is  to  get **  
**rid  of  the person  who  gave you  the money. **  
If  you want a partner, get a partner. But if  you want an investor, part of  the goal   
is  to  not  have  the  investor  anymore  so  you  get  to  decide  where  you’re  going.   
**Does the  Tribe  Trust  You? **  
In business-­‐to-­‐business  selling, the  tribe  is  rarely  about the  corporation. It’s  about  
the  person in that slot.    
Chief financial  officers are often part of a tribe. They read the gap standards.  
They  want  to  argue  about  Sarbanes  Oxley.  They  wear  the  same  kind  of  clothes.  They   
go  to  similar  trade  shows  and  they  recognize  each  other.  They  have  stuff  in  common   
that  resonates  with  them.  They’re  not  as  integrated  as  the  Grateful Dead  tribe.  
They’re not  as easy to guess what  they’re going to be like, but  they’re really close.    
The  kind  of  person  you  are  telling  me  about  though  is  the  early  adopter  CMO.   
That  person really is part  of a  tribe. They’re reading Ad  Week  together.  They’re   
reading  my  blog.  They’re  doing  stuff  that  you  can  see  they’re  in  sync.   
You  can  say,  “If  someone  is  not  in  the  tribe  that  still  has  that  job,  I’m not  going  to   
make  the  sale  to  them.”  That’s  the  key  part—figuring out  what  anchors you say in  
the  beginning  to  make  sure  the  two  of  you  are  on  the  same  team.   
I used  to go on sales  calls  back in the early Internet days. You dressed  a certain  
way,  you  mention  a  certain  kind  of  person,  you  talked  about  something  in  the  first   
five  minutes,  and  it  quickly  became  clear  either  that  person  knew  who  John  Battelle   
was  or  they  didn’t.    
   
58

That  sync is critical  because then you can say, “In your case studies, when _this_   
person  did  it  they  got  this.  And  when  _this_  person  did  it,  they  got  this.”  And  they   
either  know those  people  or  they  know of  those  people  and  they  respect their  work.    
When Warren Buffet goes  to  China, he’s  a rock star. He’s  bigger  than Mick Jagger   
because  among  a  certain  kind  of  entrepreneur/capitalist  in  China,  Warren  Buffet  is   
the  king. That  means  if  you’re  trying  to  make  a  pitch  to  one  of  those  people  and  you   
say,  “Warren  Buffet  is  one  of  our  investors,”  you’ve  just  eliminated  the  trust   
problem.   
You have  to  figure  out, how do  I do  that? How do  I create  the  story so  that when I  
say it  people  trust  me?   
There’s a  new  iPhone app called Lua. When I tell  you what  it  does, you’re going  
to  say,  “This  is  the  most  obvious  thing  the  world,  I  can’t  believe  nobody  ever   
invented  it.”  It’s  an  iPhone  app  for  very  expensive  live  events  like  movie  production  
and  trade  shows.  You  get  every  person  on  a  team who  is  putting  on  the  event  using   
it.    
If  it’s  a  Batman  movie,  which  cost  a  quarter  of  a  billion  dollars  to  make,  everyone   
on  the  movie  has  this  app.  With  one  button  the  guy  in  charge  of  costuming  can  press  
it  and  alert  everyone  on  the  costume  team instantly  of  a  change.  And  with  one   
button the  script supervisor  can push  a new version of  the  script to  everyone  who   
needs to see it. It coordinates all of that.    
Well you look at the  app and  you say, “This  is  sort  of cool.”  Then they say, “Oh  
and  by  the  way,  the  new  Batman  movie  was  made  with  it.  And  this  movie  was  made   
with  it.  And  here’s  a  picture  of  them making  this  movie  with  it.  And  Strauss  Zelnick,   
who’s  been  in  the  movie  business  for  20  years,  is  on  our  board.”   
Suddenly  everyone  in  the  tribe  says,  “I’m in!”  You’ve  eliminated  all  the  risk.   
“If  they  made  Batman  with  it,  with  a  movie  that  cost  that  much,  what  are  we   
discussing?  Where do I  pay?  It’s $10 a  seat?  Fine.”   
It  cost  the  Lua  team a  year  of  their  lives  to  get  Batman  to  take  that  thing  on  as   
their  case  study.  It’s  worth  more  than  that.  It’s  worth  way  more  than  any  other  way   
they  could  have  spent  the  money  to  run  ads  in  Variety  or  to  do  whatever.  They   
realized that  that  was the hard part  of this product,  not  making  the  software.  Again   
it’s not  that  hard.   
The  hard  part  is,  “How  do  I  make  it  so  that  people  I  need  to  sell  to  instantly  trust   
that  we’re  going  to  solve  their  problem.”   
**Pick  Yourself  and  Put  on  a  Show **  
Woody  Allen  tells  an  old,  old  story  in  the  sixties. He stands on stage and said, “My  
first  job  was  scalping  low  numbers  at  the  deli.”  If  you’re  not  from New  York,  you   
don’t  get  the  joke.  You  can  grab  a  number  at  the  deli  anytime  you  want.  If  you  hang

* * *

   
   
around  long  enough  someone  was  going  to  come  over  and  pay  you  money  to  jump   
the  line.  It  doesn’t  cost  anything  at  all  to  go  to  Zabars  and  grab  a  number  and  hang   
out  for a  little while.   
What  I’m trying  to  dill  home  is  there’s  all  these  low  numbers  that  are  available.   
You  don’t  need  to  wait  for  a  miracle  to  happen. You just have  to  grab a few and   
present  them in  the  right  way.   
If  you  figure  out  how  to  run  a  team tour  in  Manhattan  for  children  of  foreign   
travelers  so  that you could  take  their  teenagers  away  for  a few hours   
AND  it’s  good.   
AND  you  advertise it  on Craigslist, which is free.   
AND  the  people  who  come  like  meeting  each  other.   
AND  these  teenagers  when  they  friend  each  other  on  Facebook,  because  they   
had  such  a  great  time  with  you  for  three  hours,  tell  their  friends  back  home.   
AND  it’s  growing  and  growing.   
AND  these  teenagers  wind  up  building  this  community  amongst  themselves   
because  they  still  connect  with  that  person  from Chile  and  that  person  from Japan.   
You  just  built  a  cash  flow  positive  business  with  no  investment  in  a  week.  And   
you’re  only  17  years  old.  That’s  the  level  of  barrier  removal  that  has  just  happened.   
When  I  started  my  first  business  when  I  was  14  without  a  permission  slip  from  
my  parents,  violating  who  knows  how  many  laws,  and  then  another  one,  it  was   
really hard.  It  was  really  hard  to  persuade  a  bus  company  to  rent  me  two  busses  and   
then  persuade  the  ski  area  to  let  me  have  a  ski  club,  etc.  Now  it’s  not  hard  and  none   
of you are 17.   
The challenge here is to figure out  how  you can get  past  the stuff that’s hanging  
you up—the  work  you’ve  already  done,  which  you  need  to  discard  some  of  it,  and   
the  work you’re  using to  distract yourself  instead  of  the  part that’s  actually  difficult.  
Those  are  the  things  I  need  to  hear  from you  about.  Those  are  things  we  need  to   
explore. Because  there  are  no  shortage  of  opportunities  in your  space.    
**Connect.  Start  tomorrow.  All  you need is  e-­mail.  The   
whole  world  is  waiting  to  connect  with  you  if  you   
choose  to  say,  “I’m  going  to  put  on  this show.” **  
As  impresarios,  what  we  do  is  we  rent a theater, we get an opera singer, we sell  
tickets, and  the  show happens. We  need  you to  put on a show.    
The show  doesn’t  need to be digital. The show  could be in person. The show   
could be that  a whole bunch of people hanging out  by the river on July 4th  and  you go

buy  $300  worth  of  ice  cream sandwiches  and  sell  them for  $700  and  then  you  go   
home.  But  it’s  a  show.  You  made  something  happen  that  wasn’t  happening  before   
you got  there.    
It  should  be  a  show  where  you  care  about  the  customer  and  the  work  you’re   
going  to  do.  Because  you’re  going  to  need  to  commit  to  it  even  when  it’s  not   
working.    
**Focus on  the  Hard  Part **  
I  have  a  million  ideas  for  you  and  most  of  them are  bad.  I  don’t  know  the difference  
between  the  good  ones  and  the  bad  ones.  But  I  know  what  they  have  in  common  and   
want  to  keep  putting  them in  front  of  you  so  you  understand  that  there  are  parts   
you  ought  to  focus  on  that  matter.   
I don’t know if  any of  you had  the chocolate covered bananas, but  I shouldn’t  tell   
you  about  them because  you’ll  steal  them.  _\[Aren’t  they delicious?  Michelle’s  eating   
one right  now.\]_ I want to talk about the chocolate banana she’s  eating.    
Don,  the  guy  who  makes  them,  I  think  that’s  what  it  says  on  the  box, spent a lot  
of  time  figuring  out  how  to  make  a  vegan  chocolate  covered  frozen  banana.  And  he   
figured  out  how  to  get  them to  the  supermarket  without  melting.  None  of  which  is   
hard.  All  off  which  is  doable  if  you  have  enough  money.  Hire  a  frozen  banana  expert;   
hire  a  transportation  expert,  problem solved.   
What’s  hard  is  getting  incredibly  expensive  shelf  space  in  the  supermarket  so   
when  you  want  to  buy  chocolate  covered  bananas  you  can  find  them.  Hard  is  getting   
the  people  in  this  room,  none  of  which  had  a chocolate  covered  frozen banana  
before  today, to  know about chocolate  bananas. Those  are  the  only  two  hard  parts.    
And  he  has  spent  all  his  time  figuring  out  how  to  make  chocolate  bananas  which   
is  easy.  So  we  got  to  figure  out  how  to  focus  your  time  on the story and the  
mechanics.   
What  you’re  on  the  hook  for  is  your  first  attempt  to  do  what  I’ve  been  doing  up   
here for hours: tell  us a  story.    
Tell  us  a  story  that  matches  our  worldview—whether  it’s  our  real worldview or   
the  one  you  want  us  to  imagine  having. Say, “Pretend you were this;  here’s  my   
story.”   
Tell  us  what  it  is  you’re  going  to  build,  why  it’s  important,  why  you’re  the  one  to   
build  it, and  why  it’s  likely  to  work.    
Tell  us,  what’s  scarce?  What’s  hard?  Tell  us  why  it’s  extremely  important  that  
this  happen and  it happen now.   
If  you  can’t  do  that,  then  don’t  do  your  project  tomorrow.  Do  a  project  you  make   
up  tonight.  And  it  will  become  your  project.

But this  act of  being able  to  look people  in the  eye  and  say, “This  is  what we’re   
going to do,” is  hard.  And  you  can  get  better  at  it.   
**$100,000  Speakers **  
There’s  this  magazine  I  get  because  it’s  so  amusing  and  because  it’s  a  great  example   
of  all  of  this.  The  magazine  is  called  The  Absolute  Sound  and  it  has  100,000   
subscribers. They are a  tribe. There  are  only  two  magazines  that  go  to  this  tribe,  this   
and  one  by  their  competitor.  Each  one  is  always  this  thick  and  it’s  filled  with  articles   
and  ads.    
So  this  is  an  ad  I  opened  to  at  random.  This  is  from Bob  Carver.  He’s  famous  to   
the  tribe  because  he  invented  some  very  important  stereo  amplifiers  20  years  ago.   
He  retired  and  then  he  came  back  with  this.  This  amplifier  cost  $8,000  and  it’s  made   
with  tubes  that are  40  years  old.    
Very  few  people  on  earth  want  to  buy  this  amplifier.  That’s  fine  with  him  
because  all  of  them read  this  magazine  or  the  other  magazine.  And  this  ad  cost   
$3,000.  If  he  sells  one  he  comes  out  ahead.   
Bob’s  business  is  very  simple.  He  says,  “I’m really  smart.  I  know  how  to  make  a   
better  amplifier.”   
Yeah.  Fine.  It’s  true,  but  not  important.   
What’s  important  is  Bob  Carver  has  a  reputation.  Bob  Carver  has  our  trust   
because  he’s  made  good  stuff  in  the  past  and  Bob  Carver  has  a  story  to  tell  us.  And   
he tells the story in words, pictures, and on his website. It  is not  for everyone. It  is  
for a  few  people in the tribe.   
Some  of  the  people  in  the  tribe  are  actually  friends  with  other  people  in  the  tribe.   
When they  get this, they’re  early  adopters. When they  get this  they’re going to invite  
over  all  their  friends  to  listen  to  it.  And  they  will  repeat  Bob’s  story  to  them the  best   
that they  can.    
So  for  example,  you  can  remove  the  tubes  and  replace  them with  Chinese  tubes,   
Russian  tubes,  or  tubes  from Syracuse  New  York  and they all  sound just  a  little  
different.  Why  is  this  important?   
It’s  not because we need  our  Bob Dylan to sound  a little different, but because  
the  act  of  changing  the  tubes  is  fun.  And  the  act  of  talking  about  it  is  more  fun  still   
because  it  makes  us  un-­‐lonely  and  gives  us  a chance  to  connect with  people  in our   
tribe.    
That’s  Bob’s  story,  which  is  totally  different  than  this  company’s  story.   
This  company  does  $100  million  in  sales  selling  speakers  that  cost  between   
$20,000-­‐$100,000 a pair. That’s for two, so you have to divide by two. The people  
who  buy  these  speakers  buy  them for  two  reasons.  One,  they’re  wicked  loud.  And   
   
62   

* * *

   
   
two,  it’s  from this  company.  This  company  cannot  be  criticized  because  they’re  the   
biggest at doing what they  do.    
So if you’re insecure and  you invite people over  and  they say, “Boy those are butt  
ugly  speakers.”  The  first  thing  you  do  is  turn  them up  really  loud  because  they’re  not   
stereophiles. They just  want  hear that  it’s loud.    
The  second  thing  you  do  is  you  say,  “It’s  from Wilson.  As  you  know  they’re  the   
biggest  in  the  industry.  I  must  know  what  I’m talking  about.”  Totally  different  story   
told  to  the  same  tribe.   
Moving  on  to  a  couple  other  examples.   
Some  of  the  things  that  are  sold,  like  this  guy  right  here,  he  sells  these  amplifiers.  
The  reason  that  people  will  buy  them is  because  every  big  city  has  one  or  two   
dealers  who  have  a  showroom where  you  can  go  listen  to  this  stuff  and  he’s  in   
almost  all  of  them.   
What he  has  that’s  scarce  is  a relationship with  all the  dealers. The  dealers  trust  
him.  He  trusts  the  dealers.  He  gives  them half  the  money  in  exchange  for  being  in   
their  listening  room.  All  of  which  is  a  way  to  do  that  thing  he  needs  to  do  to  tell  a   
story  to  a  certain  part  of  the  tribe,  which  is,  “I  want  to  listen  to  my  stuff before I  buy  
it,  and  I  want  to  buy  it  from a  dealer  I  trust.”   
His thing  doesn’t  have to sound as good or as interesting  as Bob  Carvers.  It   
merely  needs  to  look  the  right  way,  be  priced  the  right  way,  and  go  through  the  right   
channel. He’s willing to pay  for  that privilege.   
And  the  last  example  I’ll  give  you  is  toward  the  back.  You’ll  see  ads  for  stuff   
where  they  have  spent  zero  to  get  dealers.  For  these  guys  at  the  bottom of  the  ad  it   
says,  “If  you  call  us,  we  will  come  to  your  house  and  play  you  this.  This  amplifier  cost   
$175,000.”   
Instead  of  giving  half  the  money  to  the  dealer  and  not  sell  any,  because  they   
really wouldn’t—how  many  people  are  going  to  want  to  buy  this  without  being   
pushed—they’re  going direct to  people  using this  vehicle—the  magazine—to reach  
just  certain  people  in  the  tribe.  They’re  going  to  fail  because  if  someone  is  going  to   
tell  the  story  of  this  to  someone  else,  the  only  story  their  going  to  tell  is  how   
expensive it  is, which is not  necessarily a  good way to grow  your business.    
The  point  is,  there  are  10,000  tribes  in  America  like  this  one.  Not  to  buy  products   
that  are  this  insanely  expensive,  but  that  are  eager  to  connect  around  something.   
The  person  who’s  making  the  most  on  a  daily  basis  is  the  person  who  runs  the   
show  where you  can  go  in  a  given  city,  running  them twice  a  year,  and  10,000   
people  in  the  tribe  all  come.  They’re  not  making  anything  except  connections.   
They’re  saying,  “How  many  of  these  10,000  people  come  to  the  Waldorf  Astoria,   
spend  two  days  meeting  all  the  manufacturers,  meeting  each  other,  and  listening—  
   
63   

* * *

   
   
that’s  worth  $100.  10,000  times  $100  equals  a  million  dollars.  Right?  Do  that  in   
three  or  four  cities—that’s  a business.    
All  of  which  is  a  way  of  saying,  if  you  want  to  stand  up  here  and  tell  the  story  of   
one of  those  businesses  the  way  I  did,  you  could  do  that.  And  you  could  do  it  without   
fear  or  criticism and  you  could  accurately  report  based  on  what  I  just  told  you  what   
they  do.    
But when it’s  _your_  project, it’s  harder. You’re too close to it, don’t want it to  fail,  
and  don’t want people  to  tell you you’re  a fraud. So  you’ll erect all these  barriers  and   
softeners between the story we need to hear and the story you’re going to tell  us.    
So  tomorrow  what  I  want  you  to  tell  us  is  the  story.   
You’re  an actor.    
You’re playing  a  role.   
And  the  role  is  to  persuade  us  that  you’re  right.  Or  if  you’re  not  right,  to  give  us  a   
chance to explain to you how  you could do it  better.

**ADVERTISING  AND COMPETITION  **  
**Nail  Your  Vision **  
Remember  we  talked  in  hockey  knowing  what  to  do,  be  willing  to  get  hit,  and  doing   
it  really well. The  doing it really  well—being able  to  skate better than other  
people—is a  key part  of hockey. It’s worth getting good at  it, but  not  unless you  
know where  to  skate and  be willing to get hit along the way.   
There is a  whole bunch of useful  technologies that  help entrepreneurs execute  
and  help  them do  it  faster  and  cheaper.  Some  people  are  using  them as  crutches   
doing nothing but  that stuff  even though they have no idea where they’re going  
because  they’re  hiding.  So  it’s  really  important  we  start  by  making  sure  you  nailed   
your vision.   
Making sure  you’ve  decided, “On this  date  in Chicago, 240  people  are  going to   
pay  $1000  to  come  to  my  3  day  conference.”   
If  we agree on that, then we can talk  about  a  whole bunch of cool  tools and  
techniques  you  can  use  to  go  make  that  happen.   
_**Q: So what  I’m  hearing  you  say is  that  there’s  no shortage  of  great  ideas,  just  a   
shortage  of  people  who are  willing  to put  their  reputation  on the  line  and **_  
_**execute. **_  
Yeah.  There  are  an  infinite  number  of  great  ideas.   
Just  go  down  the  list  and  look  of  all  the  people  who  heard  of  Y  Combinator.  Take   
whichever  idea  you  want,  because  you’re  better  than  them.  Go  down  the  list  of   
businesses  that opened  locally  in  Wisconsin  and  open  one  of  them in  Ohio.  The   
people in Ohio don’t know that business  is  in Wisconsin. They’re out there all over.    
One  of  the  mistakes  though  is  you  get  into  kite  boarding  and  you  decide,  “I  want   
to  run a kite  boarding business.” There’s  a difference  between the  things  you do  for   
fun and whether it’s a  good business.    
**What  I  learned  a  long  time  ago  is  it’s  more  fun  to   
work  on  a  business  that’s  working  than  to  work  on  a   
failing  business  in  an  industry  you  like.  Because **  
**failing  businesses  really  suck. **  
That’s  why  I’m pushing  now  to  do  the  uncomfortable  work  of  picking  a  better   
structure.    
In Madagascar  there are these guys  who have a chocolate business  where they  
pay  the  farmers  to  grow  the  chocolate  and  then  they  put  it  in  wrappers  and  bring  it   
to  sell it here. Their  heart is  totally  in the  right place, but they’re  not executing on

the  chocolate  part  of  the  business  in  a  way  to  make  the  business  successful  enough   
to  actually  fulfill  their  dreams.   
It’s  so easy to get hung up on, “This  crop of  cocoa beans  is  no good, blah, blah,  
blah.”  That’s  the  easy  part.  The  hard  part  is  getting  someone  to pay $5 for a   
chocolate  bar.  If  you  got  enough  of  that,  you  can  solve  you’re  bean  problem.   
I’m going  to  keep  pushing  back  to,  “Who  is  the  customer  and  why  are  they  going   
to  give  you  money?”   
**Macro  vs.  Micro **  
It’s  very  important  to  understand  the  difference  between  macro  and  micro.   
I  don’t  know  if  any  of  you  have  ever  seen  these  before…this  is  a  record  album.   
Vinyl  sales  are  10  times  bigger  than  they  were  10  years  ago. Clearly the industry is   
dead.  Clearly  vinyl  is  not  important.  _But,_  if  you’re  the  number  one seller of vinyl   
records  in  America,  you’re  doing  fine.   
I think we can agree publishing is  gone forever  never  to return. But, the pockets   
are  going to  be  better than  ever for the next  20 years because the people who are  
left in it care  deeply. They’re  not just tourists. They’re in.    
And  those  kinds  of  people  are  way  more  likely  to  pay  to  be  connected,  way  more   
likely  to  pay  to  be  informed,  and  way  more  likely  to  learn  what  they  don’t  know,   
because  they’re  in.    
You don’t need  everybody, especially at the  scale we’re talking about for  the kind   
of stuff we’re talking about. You just  need the passionate few. So don’t  worry about   
macro  at  all.   
**Advertising **  
When  I  was  starting  Yoyodyne,  I  used  to  have  to  go  to  meetings explaining  e-­‐mail   
was  going to  be  popular  one day—that one  day  lots  of  people  would  have  e-­‐mail.  But   
investors  we’re  thinking  macro,  which  was  stupid.  What  they  needed  to  say  was,   
“Will  Proctor  and  Gamble  pay  you  $400,000  to  advertise.”  That’s  all.  Because  as  long   
as  we  could  do  that  every  month,  we’re going to be fine.    
The real  question is  what do I think about selling advertising?    
People  who  do  not  want  to  know  if  it  works  purchase  most  advertising.   
Big  companies  and  their  ad  agencies  buy  most  advertising.  And  if  it  doesn’t  work   
you have to tell  your boss you bought  an ad that  didn’t  work.    
That’s  why  they  like  TV  ads  more  than  they  like  banner  ads.  No  one  can  say  a  TV   
ad  failed. With  a banner  ad  you have  to  say no  one  clicked  on the  link. Not true  for   
small  businesses,  not  true  for  owned  and  operated businesses, but  totally true for  
big  companies.

_**Q: Except  you  didn’t  say digital  advertising  took  off  because  after  9/11  a  brand   
manager  could  say,  “I  spent  this  much,  I’m  not  doing  print  anymore  because  I **_  
_**can’t  measure  it,  but  check  it  out,  on  the  Internet  I  spent  this  much  and  got  this   
many click  throughs  and  it  actually worked  like  we  expected. **_  
I know. I was  there. _But,_  no big brands, not one, did  that. The people who did   
were  direct  marketers,  the  dancing  monkeys,  the  LL  Beans—the  people  whose click   
was  worth  something.   
But if  you’re  a Loreal, if  you’re  anybody who’s  in a brand  business  as  opposed  to   
a direct response  business, you don’t know what a click is  worth. Click through  was   
this  proxy  that  you  made  a  good  banner  ad,  but  it  wasn’t  “I’ll  come  for  5  times  as   
many.”   
When  Google  sells  those  little  ads,  most  of  them are  not  for  big  famous  brands.   
They’re  for  owned  and  operated  small  businesses  or  direct  marketers  who  know   
how  to  measure.  All  of  which  is  a  way  to  say  that  if  you  want  to  sell  a display ad  in an  
e-­‐mail  to  Kraft,  you  don’t  go  to  Kraft  and  say,  “Buy  this  because  the  open  rate  is  8%   
and  we’re  going to  get a lot of  people  to  click on it.” That’s  not the  way Kraft buys   
ads.    
What you do  is  what Groupon did. You go  to  local bakeries  and  pizza places  and   
count  how  many  people  who  come  in  with  a  coupon.  That’s  a  totally  different   
transaction.   
When you think about selling an ad  in an e-­‐mail,  you  really  have  to  sell  it  to   
people  who  measure  the  result,  not  the  people  who  measure  the  clicks on the way to  
the  result.    
If  you sent an e-­‐mail  to  beer  lovers  every  week  with  the  beer  of  the  week  and   
where  to  go  drink it, you could  just go  to  a bar  and  say, “Don’t worry  about our  open  
rate,  don’t  worry  about  our  click  through,  just  count  how  many  people  come  and   
buy  a  beer  from you  after  we  run  the  ad.  We’ll  run  the  first  one  for  free,  but  then   
you’re going to pay for the second one.”   
If  it  works,  of  course  he’s  going  to  pay  for  the  second  one  because  he  made  a  lot   
of  money.  That’s  what  I  would  say.  I  wouldn’t  go  in  with  some  fancy  story  about   
open  rate  because  that’s  not  really  what  makes  brands  buy  ads.   
_**Q: Not  so much  they lead  with  that,  but  25-­year-­old  media  clients  would  buy  
media  and  they would  say we  actually need  to have  you  on  the  chart.  You  know,   
“we’re  getting  this  much  click  through  rates  from  this… **_  
Correct.  And  that  is  a  false  objection  and  I’d  love  to  spend  a  couple  minutes  on  it.   
Most  of  the  time  when  you  are  making  a  sale,  you’ll  be  confronted  with  false   
objections.  A false  objection is the reason they give you to go away because they’re  
afraid  to  say yes.

“Oh  it  doesn’t  come  in  yellow,  I  can’t  buy  a  car  that’s  not  in  yellow.”  Well  actually   
you’re going to wind up buying a car that’s not  yellow. You just  threw  that out there  
so I  would go away.    
In  the  case  of  selling  advertising,  which  I’ve  been  selling  my  whole  life,  the  false   
objections  are  unbelievable  what  they  come  up  with—especially  media  buyers  who   
don’t  want  to  admit  they  have  no  authority.  They’re  just  collecting  data.  What they   
end up buying is what  their boss wants.   
When I was  at Yahoo, the  front page  of  Yahoo  was  sold  out a year  and  a half  in  
advance, even though  the  front page  of  Yahoo  didn’t work. But the  boss  wanted  an  
ad  that was  the  equivalent of  the  Super  Bowl—the  front  page  of  Yahoo.  And  then   
you’d go, “blah, blah, blah, what’s  the  clickthrough  rate.” Well you’re  just looking for   
a reason to  say no, not a reason to  say yes.    
We  see  this  over  and  over  again. Now it’s  going to  happen with  Twitter. People   
buy  these  ads  on Twitter, not because  they  work, but because they’re visible enough  
in  their  little  business  community  that  they  can  brag  about  the  fact  that  they  were   
on this spot  at  Twitter.    
It’s  changing slowly, but it’s  not changing fast. When it really changes, the ad   
industry is going to collapse because this irrational  ego buying fuels it  all. It’s not   
fueled by ads that  actually work.    
_**Q: But  what  about  a  measurement  that  actually does  work? **_  
Ads  that  work  for  direct  marketers  are  bought  to  infinity.   
In  your  catalogue  when  you  pay  $1  you  make  $2,  you  go  to  the post office and   
say,  “I’d  like  to  mail  this  to  every  human  being  on  the  planet.”  As  long  as  you’re   
making  more  than  it  costs,  you  just  buy  an  infinite  number  of  them.  The  number  of   
times  that  happens  is  very,  very,  very  tiny  because  it  doesn’t  work.  That’s not  how   
advertising works.    
The head of advertising at  Mercedes Benz said, “If all  I did was run an ad the day  
before  you were  ready  to  buy  a luxury  car, I’d  never  sell another  Mercedes. I have  to   
start  showing you  Mercedes ads when you  are 4-­‐years-­‐old  so  that when you’re  36   
you buy a Mercedes.”   
He  can’t  measure  the  click  through  on  Mercedes.  It  doesn’t  matter.  What  matters   
is when you’re 36 you trust  that  a  Mercedes isn’t  going to let  you down. The reason  
you trust  is because for 32 years you’ve been seeing ads for  Mercedes. That’s what  
drives real  big ad spends.   
When  I  was  selling  to  Amazon  in  the  old  days,  Jeff  Bezos  said  to  everyone  on  the   
staff,  “You  can  buy  as  many  new  customers  as  you  want  for  $33  each  or  less.  If   
someone  is  willing  to  run  a  campaign  that  gets  us  a  new  customer,  meaning  even  if   
they  bought  something  for  $1  for  $20,  buy  infinity.  And  if  it’s  $36,  buy  zero.”   
   
68   

* * *

   
   
That’s  the  way  they  did  it.  They  lost  money  as  much  as  they  could  afford  for  3   
years  by  buying  customers  for  less  than  $33  each until  they got  to whatever it  was,  
50  million  customers.  And  he  did  the  math  right.  If  he’d  been  wrong,  they  would   
have gone bankrupt.    
**Competitors  **  
I  love  that  we’re  starting  with  this  competitor  thing,  which  is  a  really  good  clue   
about what’s  going on  in  the  marketplace.   
If  we  think  about  your  competitor,  let’s  pretend  there’s  one,  I  would  wonder,  and   
I  could  imagine  this  by  Googling  their  name:   
How  many  people  are  talking  about  them?   
How  many  people  are  interacting  with  them?   
Does  this  company  have  1  employee?  50  employees?  500  employees?   
Can  I  find  people  who  buy  from them who  love  them?   
Can  I  find  people  who  buy  from them who  are  really  unhappy  that  they  have  to   
buy  from them?   
Because  what’s  magic  here  is  someone  drops  something  into  the  pond  and   
there’s  all these  ripples. You can look at the  ripples  and  the  ripples  will tell you how  
big the  rock was. The  ripples  will tell you how deep the  pond  was. You’re  not the   
first  one  who’s  jumping  in.  You  can  then  make  some  guesses  there  about  whether   
they  have  completely  satisfied  the  market  or  just  touched  the  tip  of  the  iceberg.   
You  can  buy  stuff  from them and  find  out  what  sort  of  interactions  happen  in   
follow  up.  And  you  said  they’re  building  a  community,  so  you  can  go  into  their   
community  and  say:   
How  many  people  are  in  their  community?   
Do  they  come  back  every  day?  Do  they  come  back  never?   
What’s  the  velocity  of  the  interactions  here?    
It’s  like knocking over  a hornet’s  nest. If  just a couple hornets  fly out, probably  
not a lot is going on. But if  there’s  this  extraordinary buzzing, you’ve learned  that  
you  might  be  on  to  something.  Then  I’d  say,  “What’s  wrong  with  these  people?  What   
do they want  to own that  I  can’t  own and vice versa?”   
**Picking Edges **  
One  of  the  things  I  love  is  the  NBA X-­‐Y axis  thing, where you draw a grid like this and  
on  this  access  is  one  attribute  and  on  this  access  is  another  one.  One  model  could  be   
friendly  versus  stiff.  And  another  model  could  be  expensive  versus  cheap.

You could  say we’re  going to  be  the  cheap and  friendly business  and  these  guys   
have decided they’re going to be the Teutonic expensive, take it  or leave it  thing.    
  You can put whatever  you want on these two axis. But whatever  you pick, you  
should be in a  different  corner  than  the  people  you  want  to  compete  with.   
If  you look in “Free Prize Inside,” I listed  a hundred  choices  of  what you could  be:   
disposable,  green,  permanent,  expensive,  fast,  slow—there’s  all these  things  at the   
extreme.   
You have  British  Airways  first  class  in  one  corner;  Southwest  Airlines  coach  in  a   
different  corner. You  can figure that  out.    
You  start  by  saying,  “Is  this  a  vibrant  community?”   
And  two,  “Have  they  put  themselves  in  a  quadrant  where  they  can’t  move,  so  we   
can go to the other  quadrant  and  say  to  everyone,  “We’re  just  like  them,  but  we  are   
blank.”  And  if  it’s  vibrant  enough,  a  certain  number  will  come  see  you.   
There  are  two  kinds  of  markets.  There  is  a  market  that’s  big  enough  that  you  can   
afford  to  waste  some  samples.  And  there’s  a  market  that’s  so  small  you  can’t.   
If  it’s  a  big  market,  you  pick  up  the  phone.  You  see  if  you  can  get  a  meeting.  You   
go on a sales call even if you don’t have anything to sell and you say, “We know you  
buy  this  kind  of  product. This  is  going to  be  our  product line. Would  you like  to  be   
one  of  our  customers?”  And  if  they  throw  you  because  your  completely  blank,  blank,   
blank  (crazy,  too  expensive,  etc),  you  just  learned  something.   
But  if  there  are  only  three  companies  in  the  whole  market  that  you  can sell  to,  
you  can’t  afford  to  do  that  because  you  only  get  a  first  chance  to  make  a  first

impression.  In  that  case  you  have  to  be  a  little  more  adjoint  at  who  you’re  going  to   
meet  with  and  understand  their  pain.   
What you’re  going to  understand, what everyone here can learn, is if you reach  
out  to  somebody  and  say,  “I  love  this  industry.  I  want  to  understand  where  your   
pain  is  so  I  can  help  you  solve  your  problem,”  lots  of  people  are  eager  to  tell  you   
what  their  problem is.  And  they’re  probably  not  going  to  tell  you  the  real  problem.   
You have  to  guess  based  on what they say.    
People went  to Henry Ford and said, “We want  better buggy whips.”  They didn’t   
say,  “Make  us  a  car  for  $700.”  You’re  going  to  have  to  listen  and  diagnose  from that   
what they  really  need.    
The last  part  is the worldview  of the purchaser.    
In  the  medical  device  industry  the  purchaser  has  unlimited  money  and  an   
enormous  need  for  security,  safety,  and  deniability.  That’s  a  totally  different   
company  than  a  company  that  says,  “Oh  you  make  toys for a living, lets have a phone  
call  and  maybe  I’ll  send  you  something.”   
You’re  going  to  have  to  build  an  organization  that  matches  the  mindset  of  the   
people you want to sell to.   
**Take  the  Marshmallow **  
There’s a  study that  was done 30 years ago and the way  the study worked  is  they  
took 3-­‐year-­‐olds,  which  they  probably  couldn’t  do  today,  and  put  them in  a  room  
with  a  marshmallow.  You  may  have  heard  about  this.   
They  said  to  them,  “Here’s  a  marshmallow.  If  it’s  still  here  when  I  come  back  in   
five  minutes,  I’ll  give  you  two  marshmallows  you  can  eat.  But  if  it’s  not  here,  if  you   
eat  it,  you  don’t  get  any  more  marshmallows.”   
Five  minutes  is  a  really  long  time  when  you’re  3-­‐years-­‐old  in  a  room by  yourself   
with  a  marshmallow  and  there’s  a  video  of  this.   
One  kid  I  saw  takes  the  marshmallow  and  eats  stuff  out  of  the  inside  of  the   
marshmallow  and  heals  it  back  together.  I  don’t  want  that  kid  to  be  my  accountant.   
There was a  girl  just  licking it  a  little bit.    
What they  found  is  15%-­‐20%  of  the  kids  don’t  eat  the  marshmallow   
The  fascinating  thing  about  this  simple  study  is  they  followed  these  kids  30  years   
later  and  the  kids  who  didn’t  eat  the  marshmallow  have  better  marriages,  did  better   
on  their  SATs,  went  to  more  famous  colleges,  and  get  paid  more  money—  
statistically  significant.

Now  one  lesson  they  would  like  you  to  learn  from this  is  that  putting  off   
satisfaction  for  five  minutes  is  a  trait  that  pays  off  in  the  long  run.  But  that’s  not  why   
I told  you the story.    
I told  the story because what I hope you took away from yesterday  is:  there  are   
all  these  marshmallows.  Take  the  marshmallow.   
You don’t have  to  eat it, but if  you don’t sign up for  the  study, you don’t get any  
marshmallows  at  all.  Take  the  marshmallow.   
Don’t  hold yourself back.  Don’t  say to yourself,  “Well  I’m not  qualified  for  a   
marshmallow  or  I  probably  won’t  get  any  marshmallows  or  it’s  someone  else’s  turn   
to  get  the  marshmallow.”  Just  take  the  marshmallow.   
This revolution isn’t  going to last  very long and you’re in the right  place at  the  
right  time  for once.

**MAKING IDEAS TRAVEL **  
**Anchoring Your  Idea **  
Ideas  are like riders  and  they need  a horse to get to us. You’re idea can be terrific,  
but  if  you  can’t  connect  it  to  a  medium for  which  it  to  travel,  nothing  happens.   
If  we  think  of  viruses,  viruses  need  to  spread  on  a  sneeze,  a  handshake,  or  some   
other  form of  transmission  and  the  idea  of  that  virus  gets  to  the  next  person.   
So we need to talk about:    
A.  Is  your  idea  a  good  one?  Does  it  hold  up  strategically?   
B. What are  you connecting it to, to  allow it to  travel?   
If  I asked  you to describe in just a word  what 7up is, it’s  the uncola. If  you’ve ever   
had a  Coke, you know  what  7up is even if you’ve never had one before.    
That’s the work  of Trout  and Ries. They wrote years ago “Positioning.”  They say  
one  way  to  inject  an  idea  into  someone’s  head  is  to  find  someone  else  who’s  already   
in  their  head  and  hang  something  next  to  it.  Because  if  someone  else  is  still  there,   
we’re  just like  the  Catholic  Church  except we  don’t the  have statues on the walls.    
If  you understand  what the Catholic Church is, you understand  what Martin  
Luther was doing.  You  can  work  your way through lots and lots of ideas that  over  
time  they’ve  built  their  own  structure  in  people’s  heads  by  connecting  to  somebody   
else’s.    
So you get up and you have an idea. I don’t know enough about it yet to tell you if  
it’s  a  good  idea,  but  two  minutes  in  you  mention  Angie’s  list.  Anyone  who  knows   
about  Angie’s  list  and  sees  your  slide  says,  “Wow  that’s  a  lot  like  Angie’s  list.”    
You  have  to  make  an  assumption  in  the  beginning.  Does  your  investor/customer   
know  about  Angie’s  list  or  not?  If  they  do,  you  can’t  make  it  go  away  so  you  might  as   
well acknowledge  it.    
You  can  spend  30  seconds  telling  us  how  great  Angie’s  list  is,  how  big  they  are,   
how  much  money  they  make,  they’re  a  publicly  traded  company,  blah,  blah,  blah.   
Then you can say, that’s all  great, now  we already get  it  because they’ve spent   
millions  and  millions  of  dollars  teaching  us  what  Angie’s  list  is  and  then  you  say,   
“here’s  why  we’re  better—boom,  boom,  boom.”   
Now  every  time  I  think  about  Angie’s  list,  the  irritating  problems,  structural   
problems,  or  the  model  you  pointed  out  comes  with  it.   
We  are  Angie’s list, but we are free.    
   
73   

* * *

   
   
We  are  like  Angie’s  list,  but  we  are  friendlier  to  the  contractor  so  we’re  going  to   
get  more  of  them.   
We’re  like  Angie’s  list,  but  we  have  a  book  that’s  going  to  be  distributed  like  the   
yellow  pages for people who don’t  want  to  look  people  up  on  the  computer.   
By  constantly  coming  back  to  reposition  against  the  market  leader,  you’re  doing   
guerilla  jiu  jitsu.  It  gives  you  way  more  throw  weight  to  get  your  idea  in  my  head.   
When you talk about it, that’s  an opportunity.    
The alternative  is  to  do  what  Google  did.  Google  for  three  years  never  mentioned   
Yahoo,  never  mentioned  Excite.  They  said,  “We  are  sui  generis,  we  have  are  own   
thing,  we  are  not  like  them,  and  here’s  why.”   
The  problem with  that  is  it  takes  a  lot  longer  and  costs  a  lot  more  money.  The   
good news of it is you get to build your  own thing.    
Apple  never  said  in  the  beginning,  “We’re  just  like  Microsoft,  but  without  blank.”   
But  when  they  started  doing  the  “I’m a  mac,  I’m a  PC  ads,”  they  really  hooked   
into it. They said, “Alright  you  already  know  what  a  PC  is.  We’re  going  to   
differentiate  ourselves  over  and  over  and  over  again.”  They  just  took  all  the  money   
that was  spent on PCs  and  went over  here.   
If  I was  going to teach people what your  business  is—I  would  spend  one  minute,  
that’s  all  it  would  take  me  to  go  like  that—and  then  I  could  spend  four  minutes   
proving  it  was  true  and  important.  Because  it’s  not  clear  that  your  advantages  are   
important,  but  you  can  make  that  case.   
When  I  go  to  market,  the  other  thing  I  need  to  hear  from you  is,”   
Which  part of  this  is  going to  be  hard  for  you?    
Is  it going to be hard  to get contracts?    
Is  it  going  to  be  hard  to  get  consumers  who’s  paying?   
Those  elements  become  very  important  because  focusing  on  the  hard  part  is  key.   
You’re  screenshots  are  beautiful, but that’s  not the  hard  part. So  we  have  to  figure   
out  what  the hard part  is.    
\[Intentionally  inaudible  company  name\]  you’ve  already  identified  what  the  hard   
part  is.  You  said,  “I  don’t  know  how  to  make  the  combination  of  my  story  and  my   
whiteboard  resonate  with  people.”  But  you  can  use  not  very  much  money  to  find   
out.    
You  can  give  him $1,000  and  10  articles  from the  Harvard  Business  Review  and   
if  he  can’t  come  up  with  something,  fire  him and  find  someone  who  can.  That’s  the   
only thing we  need  to  see  for  the  first  three  minutes  of  your  presentation.  “Let  me   
   
74   

* * *

   
   
teach  you  how  they  fix  Best  Buy.  Slide,  slide,  slide.  Let  me  teach  you,  slide,  slide,   
slide.”  Then  you  say,  “Do  you  want  more  of  these?”   
When  someone  stands  up  to  talk  about  how  great  their  music  label  is,  they  don’t   
talk  about  polycarbonate.  They  play  you  some  tracks.  So  play  us  some  tracks.  We   
don’t  need to see the stuff because we’re already identifying as the recipient  of what   
you want  to say.    
**It’s Not  About  the  Technology **  
The second half, again back to the carrier  of the idea, is I wouldn’t spend a penny on  
technology.  Not  one  penny.  I  would  sign  up  with  Mailchimp  and  I  would  send  out  an   
html  e-­‐mail  to  your  list.  That’s  the  technology.  That’s  all  you  need  to  carry  an  idea.   
The problem with  the  web  is  people  have  to  remember  to  go  back  to  your   
website  and  they  won’t.    
The  problem with  the  web  is  people  are  looking  at  websites  to  be  beauty   
pageants.    
The  problem with  the  web  is  its  hard  to  share  a  website  with  someone  else.   
Whereas, if  you  send  me  an  e-­‐mail  my  expectations  are  really  low  because  e-­‐  
mail’s  ugly.  You’re  e-­‐mail’s  not  ugly.  And  I  don’t  have  to  go  get  your  e-­‐mail.  It’s  home   
delivery.  Newspapers  would  go  out  of  business  if  they  didn’t  have  home  delivery.   
You’re  bringing it to  me.  It’s  beautiful  and  I  can  forward  it  to  everyone  I  know.   
Stop  worrying  about  technology  and  figure  out  how  to  make  one  of  these  that’s   
compelling  enough  that  I  want  another  one.  If  you  can’t,  there’s  nothing  here  and   
you should just  go on to the next thing.    
**Tell  us Important  News,  not  Breaking News **  
In a world  of  instant breaking news, you’re not going to be “breaking news.”  All  you   
have  to  sell  is  you’re  “important  news,”  and  do it in a way that I want to share it.  
That’s a  creative breakthrough that  you have to do.    
There are people with the taste like Terry who say, “No, that’s not  going to fly,  
but what if  you did  this  or  what if  you did  that?”    
And  Mark,  you’re  certainly  one  with  the  industry.  You  talk  the  same  language   
and  stuff.  That’s  critically  important.  What  I  said  yesterday  about  numbers  is  not   
that  numbers  don’t  matter.  What  I  said  is  the  story  of  numbers  is  what  they  care   
about,  not  the  numbers  themselves.   
For  Traffic  Jam to  work,  the  story  the  CMO  tells  the  boss  is  what  they’re  buying   
from you.  If  that  story  has  numbers  in  it,  so  much  the  better.  But  you’re  here  to  tell   
us  a  story  and  that’s  what  we’re  buying  from you.

So  when  you’re  approaching  someone,  we  already  know the  first four  and  half   
minutes  of  your  presentation.  You  could  do  that  in  one  slide.  “Ok,  we  all  feel  the   
same  pain”  and  now  you  say,  “I’m going  to  tell  you  a  story  that  you’re  going  to  be   
able  to  brag  about  to  your  employees,  to  your  coworkers,  and  to  your  boss.”  And  the   
story  is,  “Money  spent  here  is  smarter  than  money  spent  there,”  and  then  we  want   
details.  We  don’t  want  to  hear  about  all  the  failures  because  we  know  them.  We   
want  to  hear  about  your  successes  or  the  promise  of  success.   
**Why  Should  I  Care  about  Your  Business? **  
Let’s  talk  about  the  single’s  bar  problem.  The  single’s  bar  problem is  if  anyone   
actually  knew  how  caring,  compassionate  and  smart  you  were,  you’d  have   
absolutely no  trouble  at getting a date. But no  one  cares  enough  to  get  that  deep, so  
it  all  becomes  very  shallow.   
And  you’re  driving  up  the  train  on  the  Hudson  River  looking  out  the  window  and   
you  see  something.  You’re  not  going  to  go  back  and  go  there  later.  So  when  you’re   
talking  to  somebody  about  what  you’re  doing,  you  have to dispense with how you  
got  there  and  why  it’s  important  to  you  and  all  these  things.   
You  have  to  say,  “I’m on  a  date.  I  have  10  seconds  to  make  a  first  impression.  I   
have  30  seconds  to  make  a  second  impression  and  then  maybe  there’ll  be  enough   
interest  to go to the next  level.”   
If  you do it with a series  of  questions, you discover  that you can open doors  to  
find  out  what  people  are  interested  in.  The  reason  that’s  scary  is  because  at  any  time   
the  person can answer  the  question the  wrong way  and  then it’s over.    
What  we  do  is,  because  we’re  afraid  we’ll  get  rejected  at  question  number  three,   
we  never  get  to  question  number  three.  We  just  add  these  other  non-­‐deniable  
layers.    
What  I’m pushing  each  of  you  to  do  is  get  rejected  early  and  discover  what  led to  
it  being rejected.    
**Your  business  has  a  problem  which  is  no  one’s  using **  
**it today. **  
What  would  you  have  to  say  to  somebody  in  20  words  or  less  that  would  make   
them eager  to  use  it?   
Eager  to  pay  attention  or  eager  to  pay  money,  which  is  really  valuable?   
What  do  you  say  to  a  person  to  get  them to  say,  “Yeah  I  want  to  know  more?”   
And  you  have  to  start  with  that.   
The  difference  between  Instagram and  an  app  that  isn’t  popular  is  Instagram  
only  works  if  I  tell  my  friends.  If  you  build  a  social  connection  into this, your  head  
   
76   

* * *

   
   
start  is  sufficient  because  why  would  someone  switch  to  the  other  one?  If  there  isn’t   
a  social  component,  you  don’t  have  anything  and  you  should  go  build  something   
else.    
**Big Companies and  the  Sales Cycle **  
Now  I  want  to talk  a  little bit  about the Fortune 1000.    
Fortune  1000  companies  are  bigger  than  most  nations.  CEOs  are  like  royalty.  The   
closer  you  get  to  the  center  of  an  organization  that  big,  the  harder  it  is  to  make  a   
sale. The people who have those jobs are getting paid $750,000 a  year—$10,000-­‐  
$50,000  a  week.  Their  main  goal  is  to  not  get  fired.   
When  you  bring  innovation  to  someone  who’s  main  goal  is  to  not  get  fired,  all   
they’re  thinking  is,  “Will  this  get  me  fired?  The  scarier  it  is,  the  more  sales  people  it   
touches,  the  more  impact  it’s  going  to  have  on  revenue,  the  more  likely  it  is  it’s  going   
to  get  me  fired.”   
At  the  edges  of  these  countries—these  companies—if  you  want  to  sell  the  Tampa   
office  six  Dell  computers  and  you  run  enough  calls,  someone’s  going  to  buy  six  Dell   
computers  from you  for  the  little  regional  office.   
But  if  you  want  to  go  to  the  Chief  Sales  Officer  of  a  big  company  and  say,  “I  want   
you to buy 15,000 devices,”  all  she’s thinking about  is, “This better not  screw  up.”   
If  you look at the people who sell to those  companies,  those  organizations  have   
50,  100,  500  salespeople  who  do  nothing  but  go  to  meeting  after  meeting  after   
meeting  and  working  their  way  through  the  system because  there’s  a  huge  payout  at   
the  end.    
The  term we  use  here  is  sales  cycle.  How  long  does  it  take  from the  first  day  to   
the  last day?    
The  sales  cycle  in  the  iTunes  store  is  two  minutes.  A two  minute  cycle  from,  “I   
read it  on  Tech Crunch,  I  bought  it.”  The sales cycle to get  a  sales force with 1,000  
salespeople to do this is a  year.    
Either  you’re  someone  like  Salesforce.com where  Mark  has  literally  probably  a   
1,000  salespeople  who  are  trying  to  break  open  these  big,  big,  big  companies.  Or   
you’re  bootstrapping  the  way  you  are.  Well,  this  one  new  company  is  enough  to   
keep you happy  for  5  years.   
So  what  you  do  is  sit  down  with  your  tiny  division  and  you  say,  “Draw  me  an   
organization  chart  and  who  can  you  introduce  me  to.”  And  you  spend  all  your  time   
there.    
When  I  used  to  work  with  Kinkos  I  was  amazed  after  you  walked  in  and  crossed   
reception,  the first  office on  your right,  Xerox,  had an  office inside.  Xerox  was such  
   
77   

* * *

   
   
an  important  client  that  if  you  needed  anything  from them,  you  didn’t  have  to  fly  to   
Rochester. You just  walked to the Xerox  office inside Kinko’s headquarters.    
Well,  that’s  sufficient  for  you  that  you  say,  “I’m going  to  have  a  full  time  sales   
person  who  does  nothing  but  call  on  this  one  company.”  You’re  never  going  to  run   
out  of  people.  And  if  your  overhead  is  small  enough,  that’s  sufficient.  You’re  just  this   
internal  thing  at  $10  a  seat.  You  just  keeping  adding  seats  per  month.  You’re  thrilled.   
**Selling to  Friends  vs.  Strangers **  
The  point  I’m trying  to  make  is  there’s  a  huge  difference  between  selling to  
strangers and selling to friends.    
The  vibe  I’m getting  from _\[intentionally inaudible company name\]_  is  he’s  going to  
sell  to friends—that  there  are  people  in  the  music  industry  who  know  him,  who   
know  his  reputation,  who  doesn’t  have  to  spend  a  bunch  of  time  credentialing  him.   
You don’t have  to  get credentialed  to  sell to  these  people.    
But if  you try to  cross  the  street  and  sell  to  someone  new,  a  whole  bunch  of   
things  in the  way  you staff  your  organization have  to  change.    
One  of  the  dangers  that  every  one  of  you  face  from what  I’m hearing  is  you’ve  all   
established credibility, respect, and authority with the people you’ve worked with in  
the  past. Now you’re  ready  to  go  to  a bigger, wider  world  and  the  giant challenge  is  a  
lot of  that stuff—you’re winning strategy, the strategy that  got  you where you are  
today—doesn’t  carry a  lot  of water when you  go talk  to strangers.    
**You have  to  decide  going  forward are  you eager  to **  
**talk  to  strangers  or  friends? **  
I  made  the  decision  four  years  ago  that  I  was  no  longer  going  to  write  for   
strangers.  I  no  longer  want  any  new  readers  and  I’m not  going  to  dumb  down  my   
covers,  writing,  and  my  titles  to  make  new  people  want  to  read  me.  I  don’t  want  to   
do  what  Malcolm \[Gladwell\]  has  done  so  brilliantly  which  is  anyone  can  pick  it  up   
and  say,  “Oh  this  is  sort  of  for  me.”  I  am plenty  happy  with  the  people  I  have.  I  don’t   
need anybody else.    
That  changes  the  kind  of  outreach  I  do.  It  changes  the  decisions  I  make,  what   
kind  of  promotions  I  do,  and  where  should  I  do  it.   
If  I’m not  racing  to  get  new  people,  if  I  just  want  to  keep  the  existing  people   
happy,  it’s  going  to  transform what  you do. So we all  need to think  about  that.   
**What Are  You in  it For? **  
How  many  of  you  read  Bob  Lefsetz’s  e-­‐mail  three  times  a  week?  Just  one  of  us.   
   
78   

* * *

   
   
Bob  Lefsetz  has  been  in  the  music  business  for  25  years  and  he  writes  the  most   
uncensored, off  the top of  his  head e-­‐mail  newsletter  about  anything  and  I  read  it  all   
the  time.  And  so  you  will  learn  a  lot  reading  Bob.  He  rants  basically.   
When  I  was  sitting  with  Bob  whining  about  he  didn’t  make  enough  money,   
because  all  the  heads  of  all  the  music  businesses  listen  to  him,  I  said,  “Bob  is  that   
why  you  do  this?  Because  if  you’re  goal  is  to  make  money,  this  is  a  dumb  way  to  do   
it—to  just rant and  burn every  bridge  you can in an e-­‐mail  newsletter  that  has  no   
advertisers.  That’s  just  not  a  good  business  model.”   
What’s  clear  is  that’s  not why  he  does  it. He  does  it because  he  likes  it when he   
walks  into  any  room with  music  people,  everyone  goes,  “There’s  Bob  Lefsetz.”  And   
when  he  has  a  fight  with  Taylor  Swift  and  Taylor  Swift  writes  a  song  about  him,  he’s   
going to wear  that on his  sleeve  for  years. That’s  what he’s  in it for  and  he’s  not  
unhappy about it because _that’s  what  he’s  in  it  for._   
You have  to  figure  out what are  you in it for?    
Maybe  what you want to  do  is  have  an e-­‐mail  newsletter  that  gets  read  only  by   
100 people  where  you go  on at length  about whatever  insight you have. Then you  
make  you’re  living  doing  something  you’re  good  at  making  a  living  at.  They  don’t   
have  to  be  the  same  thing.  They  could  be  the  same  industry,  but  they  don’t  have  to   
be  the  same  thing.  If  those 100  people are the right 100  people, you’re never  going  
to  look  for  a  job  again  anyway  because  they’re  going  to  see  how  smart  you  are.   
**What  you  figure  out  first  is,  does  money  _have_****  to  go   
next  to  you  when you’re  acting the  way  you  want  to **  
**act? **  
Because  if  you  separate  the  two,  you  can  be  more  true to yourself in  both places.   
But  if  you’re  going  to  match  them up,  you  need  to  find  customers  who  want  you  to   
be  you.    
Bob  Lefsetz’s  brand  is,  “You  should  only  hire  me  to  come  in  if  you  want  me  to  tell   
the  unvarnished  truth  and  you’re  going  to  fire  me  when  I  go,  but  you’re  still  going  to   
pay $10,000  for  the privilege.” Bob only does  that nine  times  a  year,  but  that’s   
enough. He’s fine.   
That  could  be  the  path  you  decide  to  go  down.  A lot  of  people  end  up  really  
unhappy  because  they  keep  trying  to  force  their  “I’m right”  on  people  who  don’t   
want to  hear  “right.”    
You  can  be  smart  and  say,  “I  don’t  want  to  talk  to  _those_  people. I want to talk to  
the  people  who  want to  hear  what I have  to  say.” You just have  to  chart  the path that   
matches  that.

This is what  I chose to do. I was at  Yahoo and I could have stayed there. I  
could’ve  had  Marissa’s  \[Mayer\]  job.  I  would’ve  hated  every  minute  of  it  because  in   
order to do those things—to  be  a  public  company,  have  a  board  of directors, and  
have  thousands  of  employees—you have to act  a certain way to be good at  it. I don’t   
want  to  act  that  way  so  I  went  to  do  something  else.   
You have  to  think hard. Look at other  people  who  are  living certain kinds  of  lives   
and  what’s  the  value transaction?    
All  of  you  have  that  same  opportunity  to  say,   
**“If  I’m  going  to  do  the  work  I  want to  do,  I  better  do  it**  
**in  a  place  where  they  want me  to  do  it.” **

**COMPROMISING  **  
The  two  questions  that  keep  coming  up  over  and  over  again  for  about  half  of  you  are   
an  overlap  between:  Whatever  I’m doing,  will  it  work?  And,  is  this  what  I’m  
supposed  to  do?  And  they  are  completely  unrelated.   
We  don’t know if  it’s  going to  work. We  can talk about if  it’s  likely  to  work. We   
can  talk  about  whether  we  can  make  it  work  better.  But  we  don’t  know.  We  can’t   
promise  it’s  going  to  work.   
What we  really  can get to  the  heart of  is:   
Just  because  other  people  have  been  in  many  cities  doesn’t  mean  you  have to be.    
Just  because  other  people  are  dealing  with  sunburned  tourists,  doesn’t  mean  you   
have to.    
Just  because  other  people  have  200  employees  and  have  a  lot  of  debt,  doesn’t   
mean  you  have  to.   
This  can  only  come  from you  which  is,  is  it  what  you  want?    
If  you could  have whatever  it is  you want in your  day, wherever  it is  your  selling,  
whatever  it  is  you’re  building,  whatever  it  is  ROAM  \[company\]  is  doing,  is  that  what   
you  want?  Then  let’s  have  a  concrete  conversation  about  what  compromises  you’re   
going  to  have  to  make  to  make  it  work.   
When  I  hear  you  \[founder  of  ROAM\]  talking,  what  I  hear  and  see  makes  your   
eyes  light  up  is  that  an  intelligent  tourist  comes  to  the  city  you  love,  engages  with  it   
in  a  different  way,  and  comes  away  changed.  And  when  that  happens  you are  
thrilled.  And  that  when  someone  who  might  even  pay  you  more  money  comes  with   
their  screaming  kids  and  wants  to  sit  on  the  beach  and  drink  Mexican  beer,  you   
rather  not  take  the  money.   
Then you think  about  all  these branches in all  these other cities, where you don’t   
even  get  to  be,  just  so  more  money  comes  in  and  you  can  get  another  article  written   
about you. I don’t see  your  eyes  light up either.    
I  just  want  you,  all  of  you,  to  just  give  up  on  this  thing,  “Will  it  make  that  person   
happy?  Will  my  mother-­‐in-­‐law  be  happy?  Will  Seth  be  happy?”  It  doesn’t  matter.   
You’re  going  to  make  some  compromises  whatever  you  build.  Is  this  one  worth   
compromising  for?   
What  I’m hearing  is  if  ROAM  reaches  the  level  where  you  feel  it’s  just  the  right   
scale in  Miami  with  the  right  people  respecting  you  and  reaching  out  to  you,  that’s   
where  you want to  be.    
Now, will  it  work?

The  first  thing  I  would  say  is  understand  that  the  cost,  the  price  of  something,   
doesn’t  have  anything  to  do  with  what  it  cost  to  make.   
Chanel  number  5  cost  $5,000  a  gallon,  and  HP  Printer  Toner  Cartridge  costs   
$10,000 a gallon. _To  buy_.  But  to  make,  it  costs  a  nickel.      
There’s  this  huge  disconnect  because  the  value  you  get  from buying  Chanel   
number  5,  if  you’re  someone  who  likes  to  buy  it,  is  extremely  high.  They  have  a   
monopoly  on  Chanel  number  5.  If  you  want  to  buy  it,  that’s  what  it  costs  and  the   
price  is  ok  because  it  tells  you  something  about  how  much  you’re  worth.   
A ROAM  tour  might  cost  the  same  amount  to  deliver  as  a  double-­‐decker bus  tour,  
but  that  doesn’t  mean  it  delivers  the  same  value.  It  doesn’t  mean  the  person  who’s   
getting  it  feels  it  ought  to  be  priced  the  same.  It  may  be  that  a  double-­‐decker bus  
tour  cost $20  per  person for  three  hours  and  yours  cost $250  per  person for  three  
hours.  A lot  of  people  are  going  to  say,  “that’s  ridiculous,”  which  is  great.  You  don’t   
want  them anyway.   
Then  we  say,  “How  do  we  make  it  so  you  can  have  enough  customers  paying  the   
price  that  would  identify  them properly?”   
The answer is, what’s your channel?   
Clearly  USA Today  is  not  your  channel.  Someone  who  reads  USA Today  or  even   
the  Times  don’t  go  from there  to  booking  a  reservation,  flying  to  Miami,  and  hiring   
you.  It’s  good  for  building  the  brand  in  the  long  run,  but  it’s  not  a  customer   
acquisition tool.   
**What’s Your  Feeder  Channel? **  
There’s this crab  restaurant  in New  York  City. I don’t  know  if it’s still  in business, but   
it  was  always  full.  My  friend  from Maryland  would  take  us  there  every  couple  years.   
They had paper on the tables and they brought  us those horrible hard crabs with all   
that  salt  on  them.  You  had  to  hit  them with  a  hammer  and  you’d  be  there  for  hours   
and  eat an ounce  of  crab. It was  always  full.    
We  looked  around  and  realized  90%  of  the  people  in the  restaurant were   
Japanese.  This place  is  famous  in  Japan  because  the  guy  who  ran  it  spent  I  don’t   
know  how  many  hours  courting  the  people  who  write  guidebooks  in  Japan   
pretending  this  was  the  most  famous  restaurant  in  New  York.  So  all  these  tourists   
are  walking in with  their  little  books  to eat real New York City crab and  no one in  
New  York  ever heard of the place. He had this feeder channel.    
So  you  have  to  say,  “What’s  my  feeder  channel?”   
Maybe  your  feeder  channel is  that there  are  20  corporations  that regularly  bring  
executives into town  with  their  families  for  whatever  reason  and  you  figure  out  how   
to  say,  “When  they  do  this,  they  are  safer,  happier,  better  educated,  and  more   
respected  then  if  you  just  send  them on  their  own  for  three  hours.”

You  invest  the  time  to  find  just  a  few  places  where  you  are  doing  something  that   
earns  their  respect  and  over  time  these  feeds  build  on  one  another  until  you  have   
this  stability  that  would  make  you  a  lot  happier.  Instead  of  like  running  around   
trying  to  do  whatever  the  market  needs  today,  you’ve  earned  this  asset.    
**Best  in  the  World **  
You  have  to  say,  “Which  kind  of  web  development  are  we  going  to  become  the  best   
in  the  world  at?”  In  the  Dip,  I  wrote  about  Google  is  cruel  in  that  when  someone  does   
a search, only the  top one  is  the  top one. If  you’re  seen as the best  in the world at   
something,  then  the  gigs  come  to  you.   
If  you  talk  to  someone  about,  “I  own  a  dozen  books  in  a  series  and  I  want  to  sell   
them all  around  the  world.  Who’s  the  best  in  the  world  at  that?”  Terry’s  name  will   
come  up  because  she’s  earned  the right.    
Now  if  you  say,  “I’m looking  for  someone  to  do  consulting  on  tax  abatement  on   
my  bowling  alley,”  you’re  not  going  to  hear  about  Terry.  She  doesn’t  do  that  even   
though  she  used  to  be  a lawyer. That’s  not her  thing. You have  to  pick the  thing and   
you’re in.    
Campfire  marshmallows  are  the  best  in  the  world  at  being  marshmallows,  but   
they’re  not  a  dessert.  They’re  in  a  category  all  by  themselves.  You  don’t  want  to  try   
to  go  after  campfire  marshmallows  because  what  could  you  possibly  do  to  defeat   
campfire  marshmallows  50  years  in the  business  that we  all grew up with?   
So you have to pick an industry—Medicine,  people  who  are  doing  tourism sites,   
whatever.    
Do  one  so  beautifully  that  you  get  a  recommendation  and  then  you  can  brag   
about it and  say, “We  specialize  in  this. There is  no one better  than us  at doing this.”    
If  Tim wanted  to  build  this  thing  and  you  were  the  best  in  the  world  at  building   
social  media  apps  and  I  knew  that,  I’d  tell  them immediately.  Because  I  look  good   
when I do  that. You’re  job, because  you’re  not  the  programmer,  is  to  decide  what   
you’re not  going to do and what  you’re going to do so that  once you know  what   
you’re going to do, do it  beautifully, get  the references, etc. it  starts to build.    
**The  Freelancer’s Book  of  Trust **  
A little  aside  here  for  those  of  you  who  are  freelancers  and  something  I  wish  I  had   
done earlier.    
Every  time  you  get  a  gig  you  need  to  say  to  the  person,  “For  the  first  three  or  four   
times  at  the  end  of  the  gig,  will  you  write  me  a  letter  of  recommendation?”   
Then you need  to  laminate  it  and  put  it  in  a  notebook.  From then  on,  every  time   
you go out  to get  a new  gig you take out  the notebook  in the beginning and you say,  
   
83   

* * *

   
   
“These  are  the  last  three  gigs  I  did.  I’m hoping  when  I’m done  working  with  you,   
you’ll  write a letter to  go into the book too.”    
50 gigs later when the book  is thick  and there are 50 restaurants who talk  about   
how  they saved the day and it’s listed on your website and in the book, you don’t   
need  to  ask  anymore.  They  just  keep  adding  up  and  adding  up  and  adding up.    
It’s  so  overwhelming  to  show  this  to  somebody,  for  them to  see  page  after   
page—it’s  Disney,  it’s  United  Airlines,  it’s  this  person  and  this  person.  Once  it  looks   
like  it’s  bottomless,  it  might  as  well  be.  Then  there  are  no  more  doubts.  You’ve   
completely  eliminated  the  one  thing  that’s  keeping  you  from being  hired.   
**What’s in  the  Box? **  
A lot  of  us  get  really  hung  up  on  not  just  the  importance  of  the  work  we’re  doing,  but   
also  how hard  it is  to  do  it well that there’s  a lot of  underlying technology, a lot of   
underlying  research,  and  this  is  important,  blah  blah.   
It’s  way  easier  to  say,  “There’s  something  in  this  box.  The  thing  in  this  box  solves   
this  problem.  If  I  can  show  you  that  the  thing  in  the  box  solves  this  problem,  are  you   
prepared  to pay?” If  the answer to that  question is no, you can save everybody a   
whole  bunch  of  time.   
Most HR people  are  not prepared  to  buy  what you have  in the  box. “You don’t  
have  to  tell  me  how  much  you  worked  on  the  box.  You  don’t  have  to  tell  me  about   
other corporations that  have  decided  that  what’s  in  the  box  is  important.  Because   
I’m the  HR  person  and  all  I’m trying  to  do  is  please  my  boss.  My  boss  has  never   
shown  an  indication  that  she  cares  what’s  in  the  box.  So  don’t  try  to  persuade  me   
that  it’s  important  because  my  boss  doesn’t  think  it’s  important.”   
To  become  evangelical,  which  is  what  Tony  Hsieh  has  decided  to  do  with  the  last   
year  of  his  life,  is  to  try  to  persuade  bosses  to  tell  their  HR  people  to  make  it   
important.  But  when  you  are  talking  to  the  HR  person,  all  you care about  is, “Does  
your  boss  think  this  is  important?  Yes  or  no?  If  your  boss  thinks  it’s  important,  I   
have  it  in  this  box.  I  can  prove  it  works,  but  first  we  have  to  decide  is  this  something   
you’d like to buy.”   
The  simplest  restaurant  example  is  if  you look  in New  York  City the people who  
own  Per  Se,  Gramercy  Tavern,  and  Union  Square  Café.  They  are  spending  zero  time   
persuading  tourists  that  they  would  enjoy  spending  $100  for  dinner.  Zero  time.   
There is nobody standing in front  saying, “I know  you were thinking about  going  
to  Applebee’s,  but  come  on  here,  it’s  really  worth  $100.”   
They  don’t  do  that.  They  wait  for  someone  who’s  already  decided  that  a  $100   
dinner  is  what’s  on  their  list.  And  then  they  try  to  explain  to  you  why  their  $100   
dinner is worth  more  than  those  people’s  $100.  But  there’s  no  category-­‐shifting  
going on.

**The Story of Charity **  
The  first  thing  I  want  to  talk  about  is  charity.  Charity  is  like  price.  It’s  a  story  more   
than  it’s  actual  something.   
At  the  Acumen  fund,  after  the  real  estate  crash  certain donors  dried  up. They   
said,  “Well  I  used  to  be  worth  $200  million  dollars  and  now  I’m worth  $100  million   
dollars,  so  I  won’t  be  able  to  make  a  donation  this  year.”   
You just think about that and  say that has  nothing to  do  with  reality. You  couldn’t  
spend  $100  million  dollars  if  you  were  still  alive  even  if  you  bought  a  private  jet   
every  year.  You  just  can’t.  It’s  not  that  you’re  going  to  run  out  of  money.  It’s  that  in   
your head you’ve told yourself a story about  your ability to be generous.   
The  vast  majority  of  people  in  the  United  States  give  zero  dollars  a  year  to   
charity  not  counting  their  church.  Zero.  And  we’re  the  most  generous  nation  on   
earth.    
The  reason  is  not  because  people  can’t  afford  it.  It’s  that  they  say  to  themselves,   
“Well if  I  give  $30  that  must  mean  it’s  important  which  means  I  ought  to  give  $50,   
which  means  going  out  to  dinner  can’t  possibly  make  sense  because  instead  of  going   
out  to  dinner  I  should  just  give  that  money.  I  should  just  do  everything  until  I  give   
the  maximum amount  if  it’s  important.”  So  it’s  easier  to  just  make  it  zero  and  not   
think of  it. “This  little  hole  in the  boat I rather  not have  open.”   
One  of  the  tricks  you’re  going to  have  to  deal with  in dealing with  charity is  the   
story  people  tell  themselves.   
The  reason  people  go  to  a  Gala  and  waste  all  that  money  on  bad  chicken  is   
because  they’re  not really  buying a donation to  charity. They’re  buying an evening  
out  with their social  circle. The charity just  calls it  charity because that’s the only  
way  they  can  think  of  to  make  money.  You’re  trying  to  do  something  more  pure  than   
that, but you have  to  realize  how allergic  people  are  to  it.    
On Squidoo  the  default setting is  all your  royalties  go  to  charity. When we   
started it  was 80% of the people kept  it  that  way. You have to click  two buttons to  
change  it  to:  “no  I  want  the  money.”  The  average  person  gets  $1  or  $2  a  month.   
That’s all  that  is at  stake here.    
80%  of  the  people  have  now  switched  it  to,  “I  want  the  money,”  just  for  $2  a   
month  and  it  breaks  my  heart.   
I started  the whole thing—I worked  on it for  7  years—so  that  number  would  be   
80%  or  90%  and  it’s  20%.  And  I  can’t  change  it.  Everything  I  try  it  won’t change.   
People  get  real  hung  up  on  charity  and  they  get  real  hung  up  on  money.  That’s   
the  thing I need  to  say  first.   
**Working for  Free **

* * *

   
   
I  have  never  once  met  someone  who  said,  “Too  many  people  know  my  ideas.  I  am  
too  connected.  The  tribe  holds  me  in  so  much  esteem I  can’t  make  a  living.”  Never   
once.    
I  never  once  met  someone  who  said,  “So  many  people  read  my  free  eBook,  I  can’t   
make  a  living.”   
The  challenge  for  all  of  you  is  gain  more  respect,  gain  a  bigger  tribe,  and  make   
more  connections.  Then  I  guarantee you if do that  enough, you’ll  never have trouble  
making  a  living.   
If  we  look  at  Shepard  Fairey,  Shepard  Fairey  went  to  jail  30  times,  gave  his  art   
away relentlessly, and  now he  can sell a canvas  for  $100,000. Why?    
_Because he’s  Shepard  Fairey._ He didn’t used  to  be  _Shepard  Fairey._ He used to be  
Shepard Fairey, but now he’s _Sherpard  Fairey._ How  did he get  to be _Sherpard  Fairey? _  
He can  show  you  a  slide show  of the things.  He was in  Exit  Through the Gift  Shop,   
blah, blah, blah. He  didn’t get paid  to  do  any  of  those  things.  But  they  gave  him a   
credential  so  the  person  who  does  want  to  pay,  who  wants  to  hire  a  famous  graffiti   
artist,  can  pick  him.   
For  example,  if  you  want  to  make  it  as  a  copywriter  and  you  write  copy  for  15   
websites  that go  viral and  you do  it  all  for  free,  then  someone’s  going  to  see  those,   
particularly  if  you  highlight  them on  your  website.  Then  you  can  say,  “I’m the  most   
expensive  copywriter  there  is,  but  look  at  some  of  my  work.”   
That’s way better then saying, “Look  I haven’t  done any work.”    
The  actual  customer  who  takes  you  for  free  is  never  going  to  want  to  pay  you   
because  the  reason they  picked  you is  you were  free.   
**Begin  with  the Hard Parts **  
I  learned  how  to  cold  call.  I  learned  how  to  make  sales  calls.  I  was  thrown  out  of   
meetings,  physically.  I  had  computers  start  on  fire  in  the  middle  of  presentations.  I   
got  rejected  900  times  by  the  publishing  industry.  None  of  that  was  fun.  But  that  was   
not  eating  the  marshmallow.   
The people I went  to business school  with, who thought  I was crazy for going out   
on  my  own  at  26,  ate  the  marshmallow  and  took  the  job  at  McKinsey  or  took  the  job   
at  wherever  and  made  a  lot  of  money  for  10  years  and  then  they  were  miserable   
because  now they’re  stuck.    
And  so  the  question  I  would  ask  is,  “At  which  point  does  the  job  become  the   
thing  that  really  engages  you  and  what  compromises  and  prices  are  you  willing  to   
pay along the way? How do you front load  the hardest stuff?”    
   
86   

* * *

   
   
**You do  the  hard hard stuff  in  the  beginning  when  you  
have  less  to lose.  You  can confront  the fear in  the  
beginning  when  you have  less  to lose.  If  you front-­**  
**load  it,  everyday  after  that  it  gets  easier  and  easier. **  
On the  other  hand, if  you do  the  stuff  you like  in the  beginning and  you deal with   
the  errands,  clear  the  table,  and  have  all  the  ducks  in  a  row,  seven  months  from now   
you have to do the hard stuff and now  its really hard to do the hard stuff because all   
these expectations have been set.    
For  me  I  said  I  usually  close  1  out  of  20  sales.  Since  I  need  10  sales  to  make  this   
work,  I  need  to  go  on  200  sales  calls.  And  every  time  I  got  a  “NO,”  that  was  a  good   
check  mark  because  I  was  one  “NO”  closer  to  being  done  with  my  200  sales  calls.   
If  your  goal  in  three  months  is  to  be  X,  what  are  the  habits  that  you  want  to   
create  in  the  next  90  days  of  stuff  that’s  hard  that  might  not  work,  that’s  scary,  that   
embarrasses  you?   
Once  in you’re  in the  habit of  doing those  things and it  starts to pay off, then the  
90-­‐day goal  is way closer.

**TACTICS  **  
There’s  a  building  on  the  Harvard  campus  called  Cruft  Hall  where  they  invented  the   
basis  for  radio  and  radar. In the  1900s-­‐1920s Cruft  Hall  was the physics building.  In  
the  1930s  and  1940s, physicists  kept leaving all their  stuff  stacked  up in the   
windows.  Rooms  became  filled  with  junk  that  was  left  over  from pre-­‐technology   
days.  Eventually  the  physicists  moved  to  the  building  next  door  with  Cruft  Hall  filled   
to  the  brim with  old  radar  tubes  and  everything  else.   
The  term “cruft  “is  now  used  by  programmers  to  describe  left  over  code,  left   
over  junk,  that  you’re  not  using  anymore  that’s  clogging  up  the  system.   
It  took  us  a  couple  days  to  get  rid  of  some  of  the  cruft  about intent and  where  
you want  it  go and how  you wanted to build what  you were doing. Now  we can get   
right  into  very  specific  things  that  are  going  to  help  you  move  in  the  direction  you   
want to  go.    
Before  you  start,  I  want  to  repeat  what  I  said  Monday  morning,  which  seems  like   
six  weeks ago, which is: starting a  business is being like an architect.    
You get to  decide  what land  you’re  going to  put it on.    
You  get  to  decide  how  many  windows  you’re  going  to  have.   
You get to  decide  what you’re  going to  build  it  out of.    
You get to  decide  whether  you want to  be  on Boardwalk or  Mediterranean.    
You get to  decide  whether  you’re  going to  invest five  houses  and  then owe  the   
bank or  if  you’re  going to  bootstrap the  thing.    
It’s  completely  up  to  you.   
So if the deck is stacked against  the business you  want  to do, know  that  going in  
because  you don’t have  to  do  the  business  you’re  going to  do. The  project is  up to   
you.    
I hope today, hearing that again in it’s  condensed  version, it sounds  different  
then it did  just two  days ago because it  should. Because it  took  us a while to take it   
apart and  restack it back together.    
The  rest  of  my  agenda  today  includes  tactics.   
If  you  want  to  talk  about  business  plans,  spreadsheets,  getting  meetings,   
marketing  tips  or  techniques,  getting  your  idea  out  there,  making  a  ruckus,  we  can   
do very quick  detailed conversations about  any of those things.    
   
88   

* * *

   
   
Once  you  realize  you  have  something  of  value  to  bring  to  the  table,  the  way  you   
architect  it,  the  way  you  talk  about  it,  and  the  way  you  make  choices will  have a  
dramatic  impact  on  whether  your  good  stuff  gets  to  the  world.   
Everyday  two  or  three  people  send  me  a  book  and  that’s  a  lot  of  books  for  me  to   
keep  up  on.  Many  of  them are  really,  really  good.  They’re  better  than  anything  I   
could ever write.  And  no  one  is  ever  going  to  read  those  books.   
It’s  not because the books  aren’t good. We can agree that the books  are good. It’s   
because  the  person  who  wrote  the  book  didn’t  look  at  the  map  and  the  terrain  and   
understand  how  to  get  from the  book  to  the  reader.   
They wrapped the book  in the wrong cover, talked about the book in the wrong  
way,  pushed  the  book  up  the  wrong  hill,  and  made  the  book  the  wrong  length.  They   
did  all  these  things  because  they  fell  in  love  with  this  thing  instead  of  embracing  the   
fact  that  they  had  something  to  make  an  impact  with.    
So  when  I  push  back  on  Kelly,  Christina,  or  other  people,  what  I’m saying  is  this   
isn’t  about  whether it’s worthy. It’s about  how  do you architect  it  so that  people who  
don’t  know  you, the way you  know  you, will  get  the point?   
There’s a  podcast  called WTF  by  a  guy  named  Marc  Maron,  America’s  most   
neurotic  Comedian,  and  it’s  free.  There  are  too  many  hours  of  it  for  you  to  listen  to   
all  of  it.  Marc  interviews  other  comedians  for  an  hour-­‐an  hour  and  a  half  at  a  time.   
And  stand  up  comedy  is  the  perfect  storm of  all  of  this.  You’re  a  stranger.  The   
audience  doesn’t  really  know  you.  You  have  4  minutes,  12  minutes,  whatever,  to   
make  them laugh  or  fail.  And  you  have  to  do  it  again  tomorrow.  When  you  hear   
what’s  going  on  inside  these  standup  comics,  it’s  exactly  what’s  going on inside  each   
one of you.    
Then  you  see  some  comics  figure  out  how  to  get  through  to  people.  There  are   
100  comics  as  funny  as  Jerry  Seinfeld,  but  only  Jerry  Seinfeld  is  a  billionaire  comic.   
Only Jerry Seinfeld  has  put all these  words  into  our  vocabulary because he figured   
out  how  to  market  and  bring  to  market  the  thing.   
Whereas,  the  other  guy  is  still  playing  at  some  Motel  6  in  the  middle  of  nowhere.   
That  is the fork  in the road.    
So  if  I  keep  coming  back  to  shipping  it,  interacting  with  the  market  place,  and   
figuring it  out, it’s because if you  get  that  part  right  everything else takes care of  
itself.    
**Business Plans **  
We’re  going to  talk a little  bit about business  plans. The  short version of  a business   
plan  is  write  down  enough  to  make  a  sales call. You  don’t  write down enough to  
raise  money.  You  write  down  enough  to  make  a  sales  call.   
   
89   

* * *

   
   
There’s  almost  nothing  you  can’t  make  a  sales  call  for  that  requires  your   
software to be working. That’s what  PowerPoint  is for. You  can assert  that  your  
software is working  and then  after the sales call  works,  you  can  say,  “I  was just   
kidding,  keep  your  money.”  Fine,  at  least  you  made  a  sales  call.   
**Until  you  figure  out  how  to  be  in  front  of  somebody   
actually  asking them  for  money  or  the  equivalent  of   
money  that  you  need  to—putting  their  name  on  your   
website  as  a  partner,  whatever  it  is—you  don’t  have a   
business.  You don’t  even  have  a  business  plan.  You**  
**just  have  a  dream.  Big  difference. **  
When  I  think  about  Don’s  business,  the  way  the  yellow  pages  became  a  multi-­‐  
billion  dollar  company  is  this:  There  was  a  partnership  between  AT&T  and  RR   
Donnelley.  RR  Donnelley prints lots of stuff.  They know  how  to cut  down  trees to  
make  yellow  page  books  and  AT&T  figured  out  how  to  sell  ads  in  the  yellow  pages.   
How  do you  sell  ads in the yellow  pages?  Here’s how  you  do it.   
Pizza  is  the  biggest  category  in  the  whole  yellow  pages  almost  everywhere.  The   
salesman  goes  into  the  pizza  place.  99  times  out  of  100  you  don’t  get  to  meet  the   
owner.  This  is  a  big  problem in  your  industry,  lots of industries. The persistent   
salesperson explains what  he wants to do is give this business a  free ad in the yellow   
pages  and  install a free telephone in the pizza place—a second  phone, a yellow  
phone.  Sometimes  it  was  red,  sometimes  it  was  black,  and  sometimes  it  was  yellow.   
This  was  50  years  ago.  And  the  pizza  guys  says  finally,  “Sure.  Why  not.”   
What  they  do  is  run  a  little  ad  in  the  yellow  pages,  but  the  phone  number  in  the   
ad  is  for  the  other  phone.  After  a  few  weeks  this  phone  is  the  one  that  keeps  ringing.    
Then  the  guy  comes  back  from the  yellow  pages  and  says,  “I’m here  to  take  out   
the  phone,”  and  the  pizza  guy  goes,  “No,  no,  no.  How  much  do  I  have  to  pay  you  to   
keep the  phone?”    
So the ads keep getting bigger, bigger, and bigger  because this is all the  pizza guy  
cares about—this  yellow phone  rings.    
The  question  I  would  ask  if  I  was  going  to  invest  in  Don’s  business  is,  “How  many   
painters  have  agreed  to  pay  $771  to  buy  this  page  from you?”   
Because  if  they have, we’re  in great shape. You don’t even  need  to  raise  my   
money  because  they  already  paid  you.  If  they  haven’t,  I’m like,  “I  don’t  want  to  give   
you  money  to  build  software  or  print  things  until  you  show  me  painters  who  are   
giving you cash.”   
**Hiring **  
   
90   

* * *

   
   
Several of you have asked about hiring. This may not work for  all of  you and  it  
certainly does not  work  for every job. Here’s the way I’ve been the happiest  with it.    
You  can’t  work  for  me  until  you’ve  worked  for  me.  I’ll  hire  freelancers.  I’ll  hire   
people to do project work. I will work with people and  then  I’ll  offer  them a  job.   
That  means  the  vast  majority  of  the  workforce  is  not  available  to  you.  The  vast   
majority  of  the  workforce  will  not  come  to  work  for  you  for  two  months  as  a   
temporary  COO  because  they  have  a  day  job.  That’s  ok  because  in  exchange  you get  
to  have  the  best job interview in the  world—you’re actually working with  
somebody.  That’s  how  you  find  out  if  they  can  do  it.   
The  other  part  of  this,  which  almost  everybody  under  invests  in  with  the   
exception of IDEO  and a  few  other people, is if your business is built  around people,  
really  and  truly,  then  you  are  almost  certainly  under  investing  the  time  you’re   
spending prospecting for people.    
The big book  that  I sold on Kickstarter is finished and it’s at  the printer now. It’s  
800 pages and  it’s  unbelievable. Part of  the reason it’s  unbelievable is  because I  
partnered  with  Alex  Miles  Younger  who  worked  with  me  on  the  Domino  Project  as   
an expensive  six-­‐month  intern.  And  I  hired  seven  of  these  people,  many  of  whom  
weren’t totally  productive  in  the setting they were in. But it’s  all paid  for  itself   
because  I  get  to  work  with  Alex.   
When you think about the  funnel, the  funnel also  works  with  people  you work  
with.  If  you’re  really  running  a  people  business,  and  I  use  IDEO  as  an  example—all  
IDEO, a design  firm,  has  is  people.   
Part  of  their  model  is  how  do  we  spend  more  time  interviewing?  How  do  we   
spend  more  time  going  through  resumes?  How  do  we  spend  more  time  having   
interns?  How  do  we  spend  more  time  trying  people  out?   
If  they  spend  more  time  on  this  than  all  of  their  competitors,  they  will  have   
better  people.  And  if  all  they  have  to  sell  is  people…   
And  then  you  run  into  a  law  firm and  all  they’re  whining  about  is  their  prospects.   
Well  yeah,  but  you  only  spent  15  minutes  hiring  this  class  of  lawyers! Why are you   
surprised  that  your  firm is  like  every  other  firm.  You  didn’t  invest  in  it.   
Again  we’re  back  to  the  tactics  that  make  your  dream into  a  business.   
**Pricing **  
The price isn’t  the price. The price can change. What  you do is you charge and if you  
want  to  charge  more,  _you  charge more_. If you want to charge less, _you  charge less._   
You’re  going  to  have  to  make  the  people  who  came  in  before  happy,  so  that’s   
probably why you want to raise the price, not lower  it, but figure it out.

The giant  roadblock  in  pricing  is  now  a  penny.  There’s  a  chasm between  zero   
and  a  penny.  Once  someone  pays  a  penny,  they  might  as  well  pay  $10.  And  once   
someone  pays  $10,  they  might  as  well  pay  $50.  The  drop  off  is  not  significant.  And   
that’s  the  distinction.    
A blog  is  free  and  anything  more  than  a  penny  isn’t  free.  You’re  going  to  have  to   
experiment  with  what  gets  someone  over  that  hump.  In  certain  spaces  like  the   
venture  capital  world  it’s  really  easy  to  get  a  venture  capitalist  to  go  from a  free   
newsletter  to a paid newsletter.  It’s  not  his  money.  He  expenses  it.  He  doesn’t  care.   
It’s  really  hard  to  get  someone  who’s  been  listening  to  Grateful  Dead  concerts   
their  whole  life  for  free  to  turn around  and  buy  a Grateful Dead  concert for  $6.  
Because  if  there’s  an  infinite  number  of  the  same  item,  their  mindset  is,  a  different   
part of  their  brain has  to agree to pay.    
**Herkie  Herkimer  and  Setting the  Groundwork **  
I  have  to  talk  about  cheerleading  for  one  minute.  Here’s  the  thing;  one  guy  invented   
it.  Herkie  Herkimer—listen to  this—he  invented  the  pom pom,  he  invented  the   
moves.  And  the  way  he  profited  is  because  he  was  the  content  creator.  He  started  a   
chain  of  camps  that  still  exist  to  this  day  and  a  magazine.  His  heirs  make  millions  of   
dollars a  year.   
At  the  camp  they’ll  teach  all  the  moves  so  that  at  the  competition  three  months   
later,  that’s  going  to  be  the  move  of  the  year.  You  can’t  be  a  successful  cheerleader   
without  paying  taxes  to  Herkie  Herkimer.   
What I love  about this  is  the  idea of  establishing the  protocol and  laying the   
groundwork. In every industry you can do this in.    
There’s a  group that  establishes what  color your appliances will  be in four years.  
GE  and  all  the  other  competitors  can’t  afford  to  be  wrong  about  what  color   
refrigerators  to  make.  They  have  to  be  in  sync. The way they do it is there’s a guy in  
the  middle  of  a  small  group,  they  all  pay  a  fortune,  and  he  sends  out  a  memo,   
“Avocado  green  four  years  from now.  Here’s  the  palette…”  and  they  all  make  the   
same  color.   
**Dancing on  the  Edge  of  Failure **  
I think there’s  a  reason  it’s  hard  to  scale.  I  don’t  think  there  are  many  answers  here.  I   
think  largely  there  is  one.  And  this  is  what  the  Icraus  Deception  is  about.   
I think the purpose for  just about everybody when they feel like they have  
achieved  their  purpose  has  nothing to do with to play the guitar, to pave the street,  
to  run  a  kid’s  shelter.  None  of  that’s  in  our  DNA.  I  think  it’s  a  dance  on  the  edge  of   
failure.    
   
92   

* * *

   
   
**I think  when  people  are  dancing  on  the  edge  of failure   
and  they’re  growing and  there’s  a void  over  there,  but   
they  keep  moving  forward,  that’s  when  we  feel  alive **  
**as  people. **  
There  are  a  few  people  who  don’t  have  that.  It’s  been  boiled  out  of  them or   
raised  out  them or  whatever,  but  generally  it’s  getting  close  to  the  precipice  that  I   
think is  ingrained  in  who we are as  people.    
Industrialist for  100  years  brainwashed  us  into not believing that because they  
don’t  want  you  to  do  that.  They  want  you  to  need  them.  If  you  need  them,  you’ll   
work  for  cheap.  And  if  you  need  them,  you’ll  comply  and  they’ll  be  able  to  make   
more  money.  Now  the  industrial  age  is  ending  and  all  these  opportunities  are   
showing up  in front  of us. So, we’re calling everybody’s bluff.    
When you talk in the  persuasive  way  that you have, lots  of  people  sign up for  the   
linked-­‐in group, but  then they are safe to quit because it’s easier  to quit then it is to  
stare down the abyss. It’s easier to quit  than to do that  dance.    
It took us  48-­‐60  hours  figuring  out  how  to  move  to  a  new  safety  zone  that’s   
really  uncomfortable.  In  fact,  our  purpose  is  finding a thing we didn’t think was  
going to work an hour  ago, but now it’s working well enough that we can wonder   
what  the  next  thing  is  and  keep  that  cycle  going.  The  magical  ironic  punch  line  is  the   
Internet  is  making  that  easier  than  ever  for  1.5  billion  people.    
I think the explosion we’re about to see is  not the explosion of  industrial job  
creation.  It’s  the  explosion  of  people  who  figure  out  whether  there  is  money   
involved  or  not  money  involved  and  how  to  do  that  scary  thing,  whatever  that  scary   
thing is.    
**Partnerships **  
A few  times  we  heard  about  partners.  Having  had  partners  and  having  not  had   
partners,  I  want  to  just  riff  on  that  for  a  couple  minutes.   
**There  are  lots  of  people  you can  go  out  to  drinks  with.   
There  are  lots  of  people  you can  go  bowling  with.   
That  doesn’t  mean  you have  to  get  married to  those   
people.  Partnership is  the  same  thing. **  
I did  a riff  in the Bootstrappers  Bible called  “Ringo was  the luckiest Beatle.”  
There’s this sense that  if there are four Beatles, everyone ought  to own 25% because  
there’s  four  of  them.  There’s  this  sense  that  if  you  meet  somebody  in  the  bar  and  the   
two  of you  are sketching out  the business, you  shake hands and you  each own half.  
Fair  is  fair.  And  that’s  never  a  good  idea.

A partner  is  a  very  special  person.   
I  had  one  astounding  partner  in  my  career,  the  first  project  I  really  did.  Steve  and   
I  complemented  each  other.  We  didn’t  reinforce  one  another;  we  complemented   
each  other.  We  trusted  each  other  and  were  both  in  at  the  same  level  of   
commitment.   
For  the  two  years  we  worked  together  we  really  made  a  ruckus.  It  was  ideal   
because  he  was  the  guy  who  was  going to go to Harvard Business School  and did  
spreadsheets  and  went  to  difficult  meetings  and  I  was  the  guy  who  was  going  to  go   
to  Stanford  Business  School  and  I  invented  businesses  and  made  flashy  stuff  happen.   
I  wasn’t  jealous  of  him and  he  wasn’t  jealous  of  me.  It  worked.  But  that  is  rare.   
What’s  far  more  likely  is  someone’s  perception  of  what  needs  to  be  done  isn’t  the   
same  as  yours.  Someone’s  understanding  of  cash  isn’t  the  same  as  yours.  And  if  you   
have a  50/50 partnership, it’s only going to take weeks  or  months  before  somebody   
is annoyed at  the other person and before decisions don’t  go the way they need to.  
There  are  two  problems  that  need  to  be  solved  here.   
Problem number  one  is  you  need  access  to  technical  expertise.  You  need  access   
to  somebody  who  can  program.  Or  you  need  programming  when  you  design,  design   
when  you  program,  explain  the  legalities  of  529s  when  you  need  them explained,   
etc.—for sure.    
The  other  thing  you  need  is  you  need  someone  to  have  your  back,  which  is  a   
totally  different thing.    
So  you  need  to  think  hard  when  you  get  started,  when  the  equity  seems  cheap,   
but  in  the  long  run  is  extremely  valuable,  what  you’re  going  to  do  before  you  take   
half  of  it  and  move  it  over  here  or  25%  of  it  and  move  it  over  there.   
The suggestion I have  is  as  follows:   
One, everyone  including  you  earns  the  equity  over  time.   
You  say  to  somebody,  “Great,  I’m starting  this  business.  I  need  you  to  work  with   
me  as  my  head  of  sales.  The  first  50  sales  we  make  are  the  most  important.  I’m going   
to  give  you .1%  of  the  company  for  every  sale  of  the  first  50  sales  that  gets  made.  If   
you  lose  interest  after  five  people,  we  learned  something  and  you  end  up  with  a  tiny   
sliver  of  the  company.  But  if  you  can  really  bring  me  all  these  sales  you  say  you  can   
bring  me  and  50  sales  later  this  company  is  really  valuable,  well  you  earned  it   
because  over  time  you  are  earning  your  way  in.”   
Two, figure out  who has your back.    
There’s  a  difference  between  someone  who  has  your  back  once  a  week  on  the   
phone  and  someone  who  has  your  back in the  office  everyday, all day  long. It’s  a  
very  tricky,  psychodynamic,  political  problem that’s  not  easy  to  solve.

For  James  Bond  it  was  Money  Penny.  And  Money  Penny  was  on  a  government   
salary of $19,000 a  year. She wasn’t  a  partner in the secret  service,  but  James  knew   
that  Money  Penny  was  never  going  to  let  him down.  You  can  have  an  office  admin   
who’s  this  person. That’s  fine.    
There are people I worked with at  Yoyodyne who were very junior, but  I had  
history  with  them.  I  could  sit  down  with  them and tell what I was afraid of and what  
wasn’t  working.  I  knew  it  wasn’t  going  to  leave  the  room.  It  was  better  that  I  could   
do  it  with  that  person,  with  the  tightrope  I  was  on,  rather  than  someone  who  was   
my  partner  partner.  I  wouldn’t  have  felt  comfortable  sharing  just  how  out  on  a  limb   
I was.    
What  I’m imagining  here  is  you’re  dividing  these  tasks  up.  You  say,  “I  really  need   
a brilliant graphic designer.” But guess  what, that graphic designer  doesn’t want to   
own  half  your  company.  If  she  did  she  would  have  already owned  or  co-­‐founded  
something.   
Maybe  what she  needs  is  plenty  positive  feedback, plenty  of  credit, and  a regular   
paycheck because those are three things  graphic designers  rarely get. You don’t  
necessarily give that person equity. You give equity to  somebody  who  has  cash  and   
understands  what equity is  worth. Then give the cash to the graphic designer  who  
values  the  cash  more  than  they  value  the  equity.   
You have  to  be  very deliberate  about this  because  I know what it’s  like  to  be  out  
in the wilderness  when  nobody  believes  in  you.  Finally,  someone  shows  up  and   
believes  in  you  and  you’re  so  grateful,  you  just  give  them part  of  your  company.   
Then  you  regret  it  because  it’s  going  to  take  your  company  seven  years.  That’s  how   
long it’s  going to  take  before  you  say  “Pheww.”  That’s  how  long  it  took  Andrew   
Harper.  Seven  years.   
The question  is,  seven  years  from now,  is that  person you gave 25% of the  
company  going  to  be  standing  next  to  you  helping  you  as  much  as  they  helped  you   
then. That’s  what they’re  getting rewarded for. That’s what is going to happen in  
seven years.    
**The Cap Table **  
Here’s the way it  works…   
Every  company  has  100%  to  be  owned.  My  company,  I  own  100%  of  it.  When  I   
owned Yoyodyne, the first  day I owned 100% of it  because it  was the first  day. Then  
someone  comes  in  and  says,  “I’ll  give  you  $5  million  dollars  for  20%  of  the   
company.”   
That  means  they  have  valued  the  company  at  $25  million  dollars.  Because  they   
get  a  fifth  of  it  for  $5  million  dollars.   You  multiply  by  five—$25  million  dollars  gets  
you 20%.    
   
95   

* * *

   
   
Now  the  cap  table  is  20%  to  the  guy  who  put  in  $5  million,  80%  to  Seth.  So  I  own   
80%  of  a  company  that’s  worth  $25  million  dollars,  which  is  pretty  cool.   
As  the  cash  gets  spent  the  company  might  be  worth  more  because  you’ve  spent   
the  cash  to  increase  value  or  it  might  be  worth  less  because  you  squandered  away   
the  cash.    
If  you  start  hiring  employees,  those  employees  might  want  equity.  You  might   
give  them stock  up  front  or  they  might  get  stock  options  which  grow  over  time.   
In order  to get equity,  there  needs  to  be  more  than  100%  because  I  own  80%   
and  the  investor  owns  20%. So  what do  we  do?    
We  print  more  shares  on  a  printing  press.   
Now  I  don’t  own 80%, I  own 70% and the investor doesn’t  own 20%, they own  
17%. The 13% that  we we’re diluted down is now  in this new  pile I  can hand to  
other people.    
The  cap  table  is  the  list  of  who  owns  what  percentage  as  time  goes  on.  It  keeps   
changing over  time.  When  you  read  about  these  companies  that  raise  $20,  $40,  $50   
million  dollars,  how  do  they  keep  the  cap  table  working?   
They  go  to  the  founders,  they  go  to  the  early  people,  and  they  give  them stock   
options that  they have to earn over the years. Even though they earned 100% of the  
company  the  first  day,  they’re  quickly  down  to  like  20%.  But  they  can  earn  back   
greater  percentage  over  time  by  showing  up,  meeting  goals,  etc.   
That’s  what  I’m talking  about.  If  you’re  playing  at  a  higher  stakes  than  just  “I  
have  this  little  business  and  I’m going  to  cut  in  my  landlord  for  a  part,”  what  you’ll   
find  is  you’ll  give  yourself  options.  As  the  employees  and  other  people  are  gaining   
shares,  you’re  also  gaining  shares  so  that  you’re  not  completely  diluting  yourself as  
you go through that.

**CASH  FLOW  **  
You  certainly  should  start  with  the  brain  dumbest  dummies  book  you  can  to  make   
sure  you  understand  the  words.  There’s  plenty  of  dummies  books  that  will  define   
the  words  of  liquidation, preferred, dilution, and  all those  other  things. You don’t  
need  big  ideas.  You  just  need  to  make  sure  that  all  these  words  are  clear  to  you   
when you’re  talking to  people.    
Then  beyond  that,  Steve  Blank  has  probably  written  something  that’s  useful   
about this  (No  Cashflow for  Startups). Fred Wilson every Monday posts on his blog  
something  that  someone  in  your  shoes  needs  to  read.  It’s  called  MBA Monday  where   
he describes this.   
One  of  the  examples  I’ll  give  you  is,  “How  is  it  possible  for  a  venture  capitalist  to   
put  $20  million  into  a  business  at  a  $100  million  valuation,  and  then  the  company   
sells  for  $50  million  and  the  venture  capitalist  makes  a  profit?  How  can  that  be?”   
Because  he  ought  to  only  get  $10  million  back  because  it  sold  for  half  of  what  he   
valued  it  at.  I  mean  anything  else in the world, if you  bought  half a  cow  and valued  
the  cow  at  $20  and  the  cow  sold  for  $10,  you’d  get  half  as  much  money  back.   
Except the venture capitalist has  a paragraph that says  “We get paid  first.” Of  the  
$50  million,  we  get  $20  million  _plus_ a guaranteed return,  then  the entrepreneur gets  
the  rest.   
Sometimes  you  read  about  an  entrepreneur  who’s  crowing  about  this  big  exit.   
They  only  got  a  dollar  because  everyone  else  who  came  along  is  in  front  of  them for   
how  they  split  up  the  money.   
You have  to  be very careful  especially if you’re dealing with dentists or other  
amateur  investors  about  how  all  this  is  written.  It’s  easy  when  everyone  is  excited,   
but  at  the  end  it  can  get  really,  really,  really  tricky  because  the  investor  might  want   
to  teach  you a lesson and the investor will  say, “Well  I know  you have an offer to sell   
this  company,  but  here’s  what  it  says,  so  I  rather  the  company  goes  out  of  business   
and  you  get  nothing  then  me  not  get  what’s  in  writing.”   
That’s  why  what  you’ve  heard  me  say  for  three  days  is  get  your  customers  to   
fund your business. Get  your cash flow  to fund your business.    
When  someone  cares  enough  about  your  business  that  they  pay  you  upfront  for   
the  first  one  just  to  make  sure  it  gets  built,  you  now  have  the  money  to  build  the   
next one. If  you don’t run out of  cash, no  one  can tell you what to  do.    
**Alignment **  
Here’s  the  dilemma—when I was  starting Yoyodyne  we  we’re  before  the  Internet.  
We  were  really  early. Then the  Internet showed  up and  I was  3-­‐5  miles  up  the  river   
and  I needed  to  hire  two  people  a week on an ongoing basis, the  best people  I could.

I wound  up buying a full-­‐page  ad  in  the  New  York  Times  to  get  enough  people   
coming  for  interviews.  We  would  interview  50  people  at  a  time  in  a  big  group   
setting. We really we’re focused on getting good people.    
Then they would sit  down and I would say, “Ok  we’re cash poor because we’re  
not in California. So here’s your  choice, you can either  get $80,000 a year  and just a  
tiny  bit of  equity  or  $60,000  a year  and  a bunch  of  equity.” Every single person  
picked  $80,000.    
I’m an  ebullient  fairly  positive  guy  and  they  still  wanted  the  $80,000.  They  didn’t   
to  be  my  partner.  When  I  sold  the  company  to  Yahoo  for  a  whole  pile  of  Yahoo  stock,   
these  people  hated  me  because  I  somehow  had  not  treated  them fairly.  Well  yeah   
but they  had a  choice and picked $80,000; they didn’t  pick  $60,000.       
The interesting challenge when you say fairly is, what  do they value apart  of  
your  company  as?  Part  of  it  depends  on  where  your  offices  are,  what  kind  of  person   
you’re hiring, and the story they tell  themselves  about  equity.   
There  are  companies  in  New  York  now  where  people  are  taking  $20,000  living   
on  brown  rice  so  they  can  have  a  huge  chunk  of  stock.  But  that  means  their   
incredible focus is, “Let’s sell  this sucker.”  Because if you don’t  sell  the  company,  you   
get nothing.    
Is  that  the  employee  that  you  want?  If  that’s  your  goal,  that’s  the  employee  you   
want and  everyone  will align.    
On the  other  hand, at Zappos  the  people  who  went to  work for  Zappos  didn’t get  
a lot of  equity. People  who  went to  work for  Zappos  got the  ability  and  insistence   
that  they  do  unbelievable  customer  service.  That’s  what  he  hired  for,  that’s  what  he   
rewarded for,  that’s what  he paid for,  and that’s what  people got.  There was  
alignment.   
That’s the first  thing I would say, you need to think  about  what  do you want   
people to want and  how do you tell a story about that?    
That’s  why  what  we  know  about  money  is  past  a  certain  amount  money  is  a  de-­‐  
motivator,  it’s  not  a  motivator.  Even  commissioned  sales  people  tend  to  perform  
better  in  alignment  with  their  company  when  you  get  rid  of  their  commissions.  This   
is  in  Dan  Pink’s  book  Selling  is  Human.   
We  think  people  are  motivated  by  money,  but  they  rarely  are.  They’re  motivated   
by  the  story  they  tell  themselves  about  money.  It’s  a  fundamentally  different  thing.   
You then say to  yourself,    
“Well what are  we  trying to  do  here?    
Are  we  trying  to  get  cash  flow  positive  and  if  so,  are  we  going  to  reward  people   
the  day  that happens?

What  metric  are  we  using  and  what’s  the  reward  that  goes  for it?”   
The  summer  I  co-­‐ran  my  summer  camp  up  in  Canada  it  was  bankrupt  literally   
the  year  before  and  the  granddaughter  of  the  founder  and  I  came  in  to  fix  it.  The  first   
thing  I  did  was  triple  the  price  of  the  camp.  The  reason  I  did  that  was  you’re  either   
going  to  send  your  kid  to  camp  or  you’re  not.  If  you’re  going  to  send  your  kid  to   
camp,  you  tend  to  pick  a  camp  based  on  how  much  it  costs.  And  rich  people  want  a   
camp  that  costs  more  because  it’s  a  signal  that  it’s  a  good  camp.  Well  I  didn’t  care   
what kind  of  people  sent  their  kids  so  I  picked  rich  people.  That  act  saved  the  camp.   
That  was a  storytelling thing.    
Then we get  all  these 19-­‐year-­‐olds on our staff and the question you ask, the  
question you want  the staff to think  about  is, “How  does the staff decide if they’ve  
done  a  good  job?  How  do  they  push  themselves  to  be  in  alignment  with  you?”   
What  I  said  to  them was,  “A lot  of  people  come  here  and  stay  for  eight  weeks,  but   
more  and  more  of  the  kids  stay  for  four  weeks.  One  way  we  can  tell  if  we’re  doing  a  
good  job  how  many  of  the  four  week  kids  call  their  parents  and  insist  they  stay  for   
eight  week?”   
So I sat the staff down, these are 19-­‐year-­‐olds,  and  I  say,  “Here’s  the  deal.  If  more   
than nine  kids  (in previous  years  it was  one)  call their  parents  and  insist  on staying  
eight  weeks, we’re going to throw  all  90 of you, the staff, a  blowout  five-­‐hour party.  
We’re  going  to  have  a  giant  rotisserie  animal  on  a  stick.  A chef’s  going  to  come  from  
Toronto. We’re going to have pizza. This whole blowout. We’re not  going to talk   
about  it  everyday.  I’m just  telling  you  we’re  going  to  keep  track  of  this.”   
It  was  like  18  kids  decided  to  stay  the  whole  summer.  We  were  in  alignment   
because  there  was  nothing a counselor  could  do  to  get the  kid  to  stay  other  than  
making  sure  the kid  was  happy. It’s  the only way you get a kid  to stay. The  
performance  of  the  staff  went  exactly  in  the  direction  we  wanted.   
We  didn’t say, “We’ll give  half  the  profit to  you.” You’re  19-­‐years-­‐old. We said  
“We’ll  put  an  animal  on  a  stick  and  you  can  spend  all  night  eating  it.”  And  it  worked.   
It  worked  all  around.  The  staff  enjoyed  the  process,  it  saved  the  camp,  and  the  kids   
benefited.   
So when you’re saying what’s fair, I think what’s fair  is generally sort of  
transparent  but  not  completely.  Because  open-­‐book  management  is  really  fraught   
with  issues  in  a  fast  growing  company.  You  have  to  make  sure  people  understand   
equity the way you do and it’s unbelievable how  few  do.    
If  we went to Yelp’s  or  Foursquare’s  headquarters  right now and  we sat down  
with  any  employee  and  said,  “How  many  shares  do  you  own?”  They  would  know.   
Then  if  we  said,  “How  many  shares  does  the  company  have?”  They  wouldn’t  know.   
That’s  the  only  number  that  matters.  Owning  10,000  shares  is  irrelevant  if   
there’s  100  million  shares  outstanding.    
   
99   

* * *

   
   
One  of  the  very first things  I did  when we  started  hiring people  after  we  raised   
money  at  Yoyodyne  was  I  split  the  shares  100  for  1  so  I  had  more  shares  to  give  out.   
Then  I  would  give  lessons  to  people,  I’d  say,  “This  is  how  many  shares  there  are.  
This  is  your  percentage.  This  is  what  percentage  matters.”   
It  didn’t  matter.   
People just  like saying they own 10,000 shares as opposed to 100 shares. It   
didn’t  cost  me  anything  more  to  add  two  zeros  to  the  number  of  shares,  but  in  their   
head  that  number  is  what  mattered  to  them.  I  was  incredibly  transparent  and  taught   
classes about  all  this, but  that’s not  what  people think  about  when they do this.    
All  of  those  factors  kick  in  when  you  think  about  what’s  fair,  and  how  do  we   
make  a  pool  for  these  employees, percentages, and things like that. It  just  leads to all   
this  de-­‐motivation  when  what  you  really  want  is  alignment.   
**Drawing a  Line **  
_**Q: I’m  wondering  about  personal  financing  your  company and  where  you  draw   
the  line  if  you’re  funding  it  yourself? **_  
Rule  number  one  is  you  never  put  up  your  house.  Don’t  laugh.  This  means  you   
can’t  sign a personal  guarantee on anything. “You want  to rent  this?  Ok  I’ll  rent  this,  
but  I’m not  signing  a  personal  guarantee  on  anything.”   
I have not signed  a personal guarantee. I was bankrupt  for eight  years. I was this  
close  from having  to  close  down  for  eight  years  and  I  still  never  signed  a  personal   
guarantee for  anything. That is a line I have chosen to never  cross and I encourage  
everyone  to  do.  The  minute  you  do,  suddenly  there’s  a 3-­‐year-­‐old  at  home  who’s   
going  to  have  to  live  on  the  street  if  you  make  a  mistake.  I  just  don’t  know  how  to   
take  risks  when that’s  at stake.    
Then the advice that  I give people is, if we’re going to be intentional  about  this,  
you need to write  down  a  number  and  a  period  of  time.   
The  number,  it  can  be  as  big  a  number  as  you  want,  is  the  maximum amount  of   
money  under  any  circumstances  no  matter  what  that  you’re  willing  to  put  in.  And   
when  you  hit  that  number  you  can’t  put  in  another  penny.   
People  hate  this.  They  say,  “But  what  if  something  blah,  blah,  blah.”  NO.  There   
just  has  to  be  a  number.   
The  second  one  is,  “How  much  time  before  you  give  up?”  And  again,  it  can  be  20   
years.  Fine.  But  you  can’t  say,  “19  years  and  11  months  into  it,  but  wait  there’s one  
more  deal  that  might  come  through.”   
   
100   

* * *

   
   
You  just  have  those  two  numbers  because  if  those  two  numbers  are  in  place  and   
your spouse is aligned with it, you never have to worry about  it  again. It’s off the  
table.   
This whole situational  thing, “I just  need  $2,000  more,”  that’s  lying  to  yourself.   
The  discipline  early  on  is  so  valuable  because  then  you  can  spend  100%  of  your  time   
focusing.    
With  Yoyodyne  when  we  raised  $5  million  dollars,  I  thought  that  was  more   
money  than  in  the  history  of  the  world.  Then  the  Internet  boom took  off  and  our   
competitors  raised  $40  million.  Our  competitors  were  selling  our  product  for  $0  and   
we  couldn’t  sell  it  for  $0.  There  was  this  huge  disconnect  between  how  much  money   
we  had  and  how  much  money  we  needed.   
I spent the last  nine  months  before  we  sold  the  company  trying  to  raise  money.   
In one day I went to three different states  to do pitches. It was  really draining,  
demoralizing,  and  had  nothing  to  do  with  my  business.  If  I  had  spent  all  that  time   
actually  building  my  business, I would have been better off.   
So  you  raise  more  money  than  you  think  you  need  and  you  treat  it  like  it’s  the   
last  money  you’re  ever  going  to  have.  It’s  way  better  than  always  wondering  where   
that  next  nickel  is  going  to  come  from.   
**Factoring **  
So here’s the  deal.  You’re  a  brilliant  designer.  You  come  up  with  an  idea  for  a  t-­‐shirt.  
You go  to  Macys  and  you say to  Macys, “I think you should  sell this.” It’s  January.  
They say, “We love it  for our fall  catalog, for our fall  store. We’re going to order  
20,000 t-­‐shirts.”  They give you  a  purchase order.    
Now  you  have  to  go  make  20,000  t-­‐shirts.  You  figure  out  you  can  have  them  
made  in  Italy,  China,  or  wherever  and  the  people  who  are  going  to  make  it  say,  “That   
will be  $100,000  please.”    
You don’t have  $100,000  because  Macy’s  isn’t  going  to  pay  you  until  December,   
90  days  after  they  get  the  shirts.  This  is  called  a  cash  flow  problem.   
Your  business  is  looking really good. You get to  book the  fact that you have  an  
order, but  you don’t  have cash. In fact  you can go bankrupt  from having  too  many   
orders.    
So there’s a business called factoring. What you do is you walk down to Thirty-­‐  
third  Street  and  show  someone  the  piece  of  paper  from Macys,  an  order  for   
$200,000.  He  buys  the  piece  of  paper  from you  and  gives  you  $160,000 in cash. It’s  
now  his  job  to  go  get  that  money  from Macys  when  it’s  due.  You  take  the  $160,000,   
you  pay  the  factor  $100,000,  and  the  money  that’s  left  over  is  your  profit.   
Interesting,  you  gave  away  almost  half  your  profit  to  someone  who  only  did  five   
minutes  worth  of  work.  He  solved  your  cash  flow  problem.  See  what  that’s  about?   
   
101   

* * *

   
   
That’s  why  a  company  like  Amazon  or  Wal-­‐Mart can grow so  fast. Because   
Amazon  and  Wal-­‐Mart does  it opposite.    
Wal-­‐Mart  says  to  Proctor  &  Gamble,  “We’ll  take  a  million  boxes  of  Tide,” and   
Proctor  &  Gamble  says,  “Ok,  you  owe  us  $3  million  dollars  in  30  days.”  And  Wal-­‐Mart  
sells  it  in  3  days.  So  for  27  days  they  get  to  keep  $3  million  dollars  to  build  new   
buildings, run new ads, whatever  before  they  actually  have  to  pay  P&G.    
The faster  Amazon  and  Wal-­‐Mart grows, the  better  their  cash  flow is  because   
they  get  the  money  before  they  have  to  pay  it.  Whereas  for  most  of  you,  you’re  going   
to  have  to  pay  the  money  before  you  get  it.   
That’s why when you’re choosing to build any business you  want,  you  might  as   
well build  one  where  the  cash  flow is  in your  favor  as  opposed  to  one  where  the   
cash  flow  isn’t  in  your  favor.  You  might  was  well  build  one  where  the  money  comes   
in before you need to spend it  given the choice.    
**How  Many  Days Can  You  Stay  in  Business? **  
When  I  was  a  struggling  entrepreneur,  I  only  kept  track  of  one  thing:  how  many   
days can I  still  stay in business.    
If  the  number  was  getting  too  low,  I  would  say,  “I  have  to  go  do  a  project  that’s   
going  to  pay.  I  have  to  go  to  some  freelance  work.  I  have  to  go  figure  out  how  to  sell   
a  $50,000  book  instead  of  spending  all  my  time  on  a  $500,000  book  because  I  need   
the  money.”    
When  there  was  enough  of  a  cushion  I  could  say,  “Now  I  can  invest  time  in   
whether  it’s  personal  growth,  etc.”  These  Stanley  Kaplan  SAT  books  I  did  that  got   
them into  the  book  business  took  me  five  years  to  persuade  Stanley  Kaplan,  the   
man,  to  say  yes.  For  five  years  I  was  investing  time  on  spec  and  got  nothing.  I  would   
have to stop for a while  to go sell a book, Buzzword  Bingo, which we thought of  on a  
Monday, sold  on Wednesday, and  got paid  on Friday  because  that paid  six weeks   
worth  of  rent.

**THE  DIP **  
I’m going  to  talk  about  “The  Dip”  for  10  minutes.  How  many  have  read  it?  Raise  your   
hand.  Wow,  my  publisher  did  not  want  to  publish  it.  They  only  agreed  to  publish  it  if   
I would  write a real book.    
There are a  couple things in this book  that  are misunderstood,  so  let  me  try  to   
clarify, and for those of you who haven’t  read it  catch you up.   
In our  society starting stuff  is  applauded.    
When  you  say  to  your  grandmother,  “I’m pre-­‐med,”  party  will  ensure.   
When  you  join  a  gym you  already  feel  healthier.  All  you  did  was  sign  a  check.   
When you tell people  you’re  engaged, parties  will ensure.    
There’s this sense that  going down a  new  road is exciting. Clean paper in your  
notebook.  Lot’s  of  people  start  stuff  and  almost  nobody  finishes  stuff.   
Very few  pre-­‐meds  end  up  becoming  neurosurgeons.  Half  of  all  marriages  end  up   
in divorce. You can go down the list. There are lots of things we say we’re going to  
do  on  a  Wednesday  afternoon  that  three  months,  four  months,  six  months,  or  two   
years down the road we’re not  doing  it  anymore.  Why?   
If  we  look  at  the  economics  of  the  situation,  it’s  this:  the  reason  those  outcomes   
are  valuable  is  because  they’re  scarce. There  aren’t a lot of  neurosurgeons, which  is   
why  neurosurgeons  get paid  a lot. If  everyone  was  a neurosurgeon, brain surgery  
would  be  cheap. But in fact there  are  few.   
So  how  do  we  go  from lots  of  people  start  businesses,  lots  of  people  start   
projects,  lots  of  people  open  restaurants,  etc,  etc,  to  only  a  few  come  out  at  the  other   
end?   
Add  to  that  what  Google  did.  What  Google  did  was  they  made  it  from hundreds  of   
hundreds of people having hundreds of hundreds quiet  individual  conversations to  
one  answer  to  most  searches.  “I  need  a  copywriter  who  specializes  in  direct  mail   
copy  for  pharmaceutical  companies.”  There’s  one  match,  number  one  in  Google,  just  
one.    
There’s an interesting study a  guy did, but  I don’t  really know  who to credit  it  to.  
You  get  a  letter  from a  lawyer  and  what  the  lawyer  says  is,  “I  represent  a  client  who   
recently  passed  away  and  left  $5  million dollars. You get half  of  it if  you find  the   
other person who also gets half of it. If the two of you, strangers, find each other, you  
each  get  $2.5  million  dollars.  You  need  to  find  each  other  at  noon  on  September  10th   
in Paris and you’re not  allowed to  run any  ads  or  do  anything to  actively  find  each   
other.”

The  question  I  would  ask  you  is,  what  would  you  do  to  maximize  the  chances  you   
met  this  other  person  at  noon  on  September  10th?    
The  vast  majority  of  people  on  the  planet  say  I  would  go  to  the  base of the Eiffel   
Tower. It  turns out  the base of the Eiffel  Tower is the best  in the world to the  
solution  to  this  problem.  And  in  New  York  City,  if  you  ask  people  from New  York,  it’s   
the  clock at Grand  Central Station.    
You’re  making  a  face,  is  that  where  you would  go?    
_**Q: I’d  go to the  Empire  State  Building**_**.  **  
Interesting.  The  problem with  the  Empire  State  Building  is  there  isn’t  a  place  at   
the  Empire  State  Building.  There  are  too  many  places  to  stand  at  the  Empire  State   
Building.  I’m not  saying  it’s  right  or  wrong,  I’m saying  I  happen  to  agree  with  both  of   
them.  The  interesting  thing  is  nobody  says,  “I  would  go  to  yonah  schimmel  knish’s   
place.”  No  one  says,  “I  would  go  to  Shake  Shack.”  Everyone  or  most  of  the  people   
pick one place.    
When you are  _the_ place,  when  you  are  the  Nike,  Apple,  Facebook  examples  that   
all  business  writers  use  every  time;  When  you  are  the  CrossFit,  not  the  guy  who’s   
sort  of like CrossFit; When you  are seen as the best  in the world, the benefits are  
outsized.  You  come  out  way  ahead  in  trust,  revenue,  profitability,  ability  to  make   
noise, and anything it is you seek to do if you are seen as the best in the world.   
What  does  best  in  the  world  mean?  It  means  world  as  in  my  world,  the  only  little   
place I care about, not the wide wide world.    
I was  telling Don about the realtor  down the street, he’s  the best in the world  at  
selling  residential  houses  in  the  10706  zipcode.  It’s  not  the  world  world,  it’s  my   
world.    
Best  doesn’t  mean  the  most  expensive  or  the  most  supreme  or  the  fanciest,  it  just   
means  the  one  I  will  pick.  The  one  I  will  pick  for  my  budget.  The  one  that  I  choose  is   
the  best  because  why  would  I  pick  anything  other  than  my  best  option?   
The goal  in whatever we build is to be the best  in the world at  it  and thanks to  
the  Internet it’s  easier  for  it to be just one. The reason we can’t all be the best in the  
world  is  because  it’s  scarce  and  somewhere  between  the  day  we  get  excited  and   
start  and the end, we quit. So it’s a  book  about  quitting.    
I have two things  to say about quitting.    
One,  quitting  is  underrated.  We  quit  things  all  the  time.  Most  of  you  don’t  still   
take  ballet  lessons.  Some  people  in  this  room when  you  were  4-­‐years-­‐old had a  tutu.  
You  don’t  have  a  tutu  anymore.  I  hope.  Along  the  way  you  quit  ballet  and  you  don’t   
beat yourself up  about  it. That’s just  part  of what  it  is to do things, you  quit.    
Two,  the  thing  is  we  quit  the  wrong  things  at  the  wrong  time.

We  quit  our  workout  schedule  right  before  it’s  something  that’s  about  to  become   
a  habit  and  actually  make  us  healthy.   
We  quit  the  marathon,  not  at  mile  2  when  everyone’s  cheering  us  on,  but  at  mile   
22, which is when everyone quits. If we just  went  a  little further, we get  all  the  
benefits  of  finishing,  but  it’s  in  that  moment  when  we  can’t  go  on  that  we  quit.   
What I argue  for  is  a  really  simple  thing.   
**Don’t  start  anything  unless  you’ve  invested  what  it’s **  
**going to  take to  finish it. **  
I’m not  talking  about  hobbies  and  stuff  like  that.  I’m talking  about  projects.  Don’t   
start  a  project  unless you’re prepared to go to the end.   
The start  and end are tricky here.    
I  start  writing  10  books  a  year.  I  mash  around  with  them and  I  play  around  with   
them and  I  don’t  tell  anyone  about  them.  Then  one  day  one  of  them is  the  next  book.   
And  I  have  never  failed  to  finish  a  book  once  I’ve  announced  it’s  the next book.    
There’s all  this thrashing that  happens in the beginning that  doesn’t  count. But   
the  post  thrash  moment  when  you  say,  “Yes  I’m going  to do this.”    
**You have  a  lifestyle,  a  practice  that  says,  “When  I   
make  that  announcement,  I’m going  to  get through   
the  dip.  I  know  the  dip  is  really  hard,  that’s  why  I  have **  
**chosen  to  do  it.” **  
In  your  case  Chris,  the  idea  is  not  to  say,  “I  am committing  to  having  a  sound   
thing.”  It’s,  “I’m going  to  stick  with  this—building an organization—until I do. There  
will  be  lots  of  detours  and  dead  ends  along  the  way,  but  that  doesn’t  matter.  I  will   
deal  with the hard part  of getting through it  because when I  get  on the other side it’s  
worth  it.”   
There are two kinds of projects. There are cul-­‐de-­‐sacs, dead ends, things  that are   
never  going  to  get  better.  This  is  the  person  who  goes  to  work  at  Goldman  Sachs  as   
the  receptionist and  thinks  they  can work their  way  up to  CEO. No  actually  you can’t.  
There’s no dip there, it’s a  dead end. There’s nobody else that  ever comes  out  the   
other end.   
The way you know  it’s a  dead end is has anyone ever done this before?  Has  
anyone  ever  persisted  their  way  through  this  in  the  way  I  am doing  it?   
Now  you  might  be  the  first  person  who  ever  did  it.  You  might  be  the  first  person   
who  ever  swam to  Cuba.  That’s  possible.  But  in  general,  it’s  way  better  to  sign  up  for   
a  path  where  you  know  there  is  an  outcome.

There are 50-­‐year-­‐olds  who  have  gone  from the  couch  to  finishing  the  Boston   
marathon.  I  know  that  if  I  do  this  day  after  day  there’s a  chance. That’s how  you  tell   
a cul-­‐de-­‐sac,  a  dead  end,  from the  kind  of  work  where  there’s  a  dip.   
Once  you  are  comfortable  with  this  strategic  quitting  model  you  say,  “It’s  not   
only  ok,  it’s  imperative  that  I  quit  everything  I’m not  prepared  to  push  through  the   
dip  on.”   
You will quit early when it’s  cheap as  opposed  to  quitting late  when it’s   
expensive.    
If  you’re walking around  knowing you have a quit card  that you can use in the  
right  moment,  but  the  cost  of  it  is  you’re  never  allowed  to  quit  something  in  the   
wrong  moment,  you  become  that  person  who  can  stare  down  the  thing  that  gets   
everyone else to  quit.  You’ll  become  the  type  of  person  who  is  still  in  the  gym in   
March  because  it’s  the  people  in  the  gym in  March  who  are  the  ones  getting  fit.  It’s   
the  ones  who  stop  going  in  February  that  make  all  the  money  for  the  health  club.   
The  same  thing  is  true  is  when you’re building any of  these projects  we’ve been  
talking about. You’re  talking about two, three, five, or  seven-­‐year processes. That’s  
why  the  rest  of  this  afternoon  is  so  important  because  it’s  not  a  three-­‐day thing  
you’re doing or a two-­‐week thing.    
The first  seven versions of the hostel  are going to fail. People aren’t  going to sign  
up,  the  health  department  is  going  to  shut  you  down,  the  landlord  is  going  to  screw   
you  over,  and  something  else  isn’t  going  to  work.  But  you’re  going  to  learn  every   
single  time.  And  the  ninth  time  you  do  it  is  when  it’s  going  to  work,  but  if  you  quit  at   
number  seven,  you’re  never  going  to  know  that.   
That  is what  you need to be laying tracks for—to  say, “I get the  fact that it’s  not  
going to work, and it’s not going to  work,  and  it’s  not  going  to  work  and  then  maybe   
it’ll  work.”   
So  please  don’t  tell  me  the  magic  answer  today.  Tell  me  how  to  make  sure  my   
process  is  in  place  so  I’m a  learning  organization;  I’m not  someone  who  had  to  get  it   
right  the  first  time.   
**Misunderstandings about  the  Dip **  
_**Q: You  mention  that  people  don’t  get,  they often  misinterpret  the  message; can **_  
_**you  explain  what  their  interpretation  is? **_  
Number  one,  they  think  best  in  the  world  means  you  have  to  be  the  fanciest,   
most  expensive.   
Number  two,  they  think  what  I’m talking  about  when  I  say,  “Best  in  the  world,”   
really  is  the  best  in  the  whole  world,  not  in  your  tiny  market.   
   
106

This  notion  of  Monopoly,  again,  is  I  understand  that  Atlantic  Avenue  is  not  the   
best  property  in  Monopoly,  but  it  might  be  _your_ property.  And  if  it’s  _your_ property,  
that’s  good  enough  if  you build  a hotel there. You can still do  just find  because  you’re   
the  best  hotel  in  the  world  on  Atlantic.  The  goal  is  to  build  that  square  just  the  right   
size so you  can possess it.    
**Signing Up  for  the  Whole  Process **  
_**Q: One  way that  I  coach  people  on  being  referable  is  that  when  they think  of  that   
thing  they need  to think  of  you  as  a  integral  particular  activator.  So when  I  think **_  
_**of  a  realtor  in  Hastings,  I  think  of  Mark.  When  I  think  of  a  realtor  in  Tulson,   
California,  I  think  of  Dave  Chapman.  So they’re  the  best  in  the  world  in  their   
community of  excellent. **_  
That’s right.    
If  I was  going to open up a real estate office, I would  spend  the first three years   
not doing what I see the real estate people around  here doing which is  balloons,  
those  little  folding  metal  signs  they  put  on  street  corners,  and  making  sure  they  have   
the  right kind  of  Mercedes  to  drive  the  person to  the  house.    
What  I  would  spend  my  time  doing  is  making  sure  that  every  community  
organization  had  it’s  meetings  in  my  offices  because  I  would  have  a  big  enough   
meeting  room so  they  could  meet  there  as  often  as  they  wanted.  I’d  figure  out  how   
to  get on the  school board. I’d  figure  out how to  be  the  assistant coach  of  the  football  
team.  I’d  figure  out  how  to  be  this  integral  member  of  the  community  and  not  worry   
so  much  about  whether  or  not  I  was  selling  a  house  tomorrow  because  there’s  a   
trust  shortage.  There  isn’t  a  not  enough  people  know  how  to  fill  out  forms  shortage.   
What we  know  from the  National  Association  of  Realtors  is  that  more  than  70%   
of  people  who  list  a  house  pick  the  realtor  who  calls  them back  first.  So  the  goal  is   
how  do you get  called first, not  how  do you prove that  your yield on a  percentage  
basis  is  better  than  everybody  else’s  yield.  And  if  you  get  enough  listings,  you’re   
going  to  make  money.   
This  is  a  multi-­‐year  process  of  owning  a  tiny  market  as  opposed  to  running  from  
one cool  opportunity to another hoping you’ll  be done. It’s about  signing up for the  
whole  process.    
_**Q: What  are  some  of  things  your  recommend  to people  when  they need  to assess   
whether  they care  enough  about  being  the  best  in  the  world  to that? **_  
I  think  people  fool  themselves  into  thinking  they  need  to  care  about  what  it  is   
they  make.   
I have done  projects  where  what  I  make  is  the  most  important  thing  in  the  world   
to  me  and  it’s  not  about  me.  But  most  of  the  projects  I’ve  done  are  projects  where   
   
107   

* * *

   
   
the  transaction,  people,  atmosphere  and  the  way  it  makes  us  all  feel  is  way  more   
important  to  me  than  whether  or  not you want this  particular  widget or  not.   
My  dad  runs  a  hospital  crib  company  with  the  biggest  market  share.  90%  of  the   
hospital  cribs  in  the  world  are  made  in  Buffalo,  New  York  in  a  UAW  organized  metal   
bending  painting  factory  that  makes  hospital cribs. My dad  has  never  been in a  
hospital  crib  and  hopefully  never  will.  While  it’s  important  to  him that  nurses  have   
this  useful  tool,  it’s  way  more  important  to  him that  his  workforce  feels  the  way  they   
do,  his  customers  feel  the  way  they  do,  and  that it’s  built in Buffalo, New York in a  
factory that’s 100 years old, etc, etc.    
Does he care about  the people?  Unbelievably.   
Does  he  care  about  his  clients?  Enormously.   
Does  he  care  about  that  particular  piece  of  steel?  Not  so  much.   
This is about  how  you put your  work on the line, not yourself  on the line, and   
what are  you willing to  do  to  speak up for  your  work? If  that requires  you failing  
along  the  way,  then  that’s  part  of  the  cost.  That’s  the  people  we  see  come  out  ahead   
almost  every  time.  The  people who are busy cutting corners  and  trying to close the  
sale  tomorrow  may  win  tomorrow,  but  they  inevitably  don’t  win  in  the  long  run.   
**Where  is Your  Fear? **  
_**Q: People  tell  themselves  stories  often  to say it’s  about  the  widget  when  it’s  not **_  
_**about  the  widget.  So Chris  is  very perceptive—its  not  about  spend  this  amount  of   
perpetuity—he’s  trying  to do the  same  thing  every time.  He  cared  enough  about   
the  same  thing  every time,  but  a  lot  of  people  have  difficulty figuring  out  what  is **_  
_**that  driving  force.  So my question  is  how  do you  see  people  successfully figuring   
out  what  that  magic  driving  force  thing  is?  So in  your  career  you’ve  done  a   
bunch  of  different  things,  but  I’d  say you’re  in  the  same  ballpark,  the  same **_  
_**theme  impact  throughout  your  career. **_  
You see  it’s  just  so  messy.  You’ll  meet  a  guy  who  is  a  partner  in  a  law  firm and   
he’s  been  a  partner  in  a  law  firm for  37  years.  For  him his  love  of  the  law,  love  of  his   
partners,  and  love  of  his  reputation  is  all  the  same  thing.  I  don’t  know  how  to  tease   
them apart.   
I’m multi-­‐pational.  I’m doing  a  whole  bunch  of  things,  many  of  which  you’ve   
never  seen  because  there  in  completely  different  segments.  The  project  is  where  the   
texture  is  for  me.   
If  I’m doing  a  project  where  I’m saddled  with  someone  who  I  don’t  respect,  it’s   
very  painful  for  me  and  I  figure  out  how  to  change  those  things.  The  widget  itself  has   
a  certain  level  of  quality,  but  I’ve  never  once  made  a  perfect  widget.  There  are  other   
people  who  make  perfect  widgets.  I  always  don’t.  I  am also  very  comfortable  with  
that.    
   
108   

* * *

   
   
I don’t know how to tease it apart for  people. What I do know is  they need  to  
look  for  the  fear.  Over,  over,  and  over  again  this  comes  down  to:   
**Where  is  your  fear? **  
**Where  is  your  soft  spot? **  
**Where  is  that  thing  your  protecting? **  
If  we  somehow  let  go  of  our  guard  and  expose  that  soft  spot  is  when  we  do  our   
best  work.  It’s  the  people  who  are  always  like  this  \[arms  crossed\] who can’t run very  
fast  because  they’re  like  this  \[arms  crossed\] that they get less done because they’re  
so busy protecting the soft  spot.    
When  I  find  somebody  who  keeps  jumping  from thing  to  thing  or  coming  up  with   
clever  elevator  pitches  or  gets  stuck,  sooner  of  later  it’s  going  to  come  down  to  the   
fear.   
If  I’m going  to  talk  to  someone  like  Stephanie  who’s  just  filled with this joy,  
enthusiasm,  smarts,  and  productivity;  if  she  doesn’t  accomplish  everything  she’s   
capable  of  in  the  next  years,  it’s  because  somewhere  you’re  afraid  of  something.  We   
don’t  know  what  it  is,  but  you’re  holding  back  on  something  and  if  you find  it, then  
you’re  going  to  be  able  to  lead  with  that  and  your  projects  are  going  to  be  much   
more  likely  to  succeed.   
This  is  almost  never  about  talent.   
It’s  about why are we sabotaging our  talent and  not going through the dip?  
Because  it’s  easier  to  say, “Oh I  failed at  this, now  I  can go start  the next  thing.”   
**The  Size  of  the  Dips **  
I think different projects  have different sized  dips.    
Learning  to do walk  the dog  with a  yo-­‐yo  is  a  fairly  small  dip  transaction.  It  takes   
about two  hours  with  a yo-­‐yo before  almost  any  coordinated  person  can  do  walk  the   
dog. Whereas learning how  to juggle five pins is a  three-­‐week dip. So  for  two  and   
half weeks you’re hurting yourself and hitting yourself and then it  works.    
Your  project is  a three-­‐year project. It’s going to take you three years before you  
make  a  big  profit  being  the  default  list.  Go  look  at  how  long  it  took  Nielson  and   
SoundScan and everything else. To get through a dip that big, you need a rich uncle,  
you  need  a  partner,  or  you  need  a  business  model  that  gets  you  small  sales  that  keep   
you in business.    
Your  choices  are  to  pick  a  smaller  project  with  a  smaller  dip  or  figure  out  a   
model  where  some  clients  are  paying  you  before  you’re  ready  to  fund  the  whole   
thing. Or  as  you said, “Freelance  to  pay  for  your  day job.” That’s  really hard.    
   
109   

* * *

   
   
The third one is really hard and the reason it’s really hard is you’re in a  race to  
make  your  list  the  default  list.  As  you  go  out  in  the  world  and  talk  about  it,  other   
people are going to want to do it too because it’s  not only yours. You can’t  protect  it.  
You’re  going to  want to  go  full speed  ahead.    
But  getting  freelance  work  is  hard  and  time  consuming.  If  you  have  someone   
who’s  willing to  pay  you $500  an hour  for  eight hours  a week, go  take  it, for  sure.    
But if  you actually  got  to  get  good  at  it  and  compete  with  Sarah,  Sarah’s  working   
all  the  time  to  get  freelance  work.  You’re  not  because  you’re  trying  to  build   
something  else.  That’s  going  to  be  a  real  tension  for  you.   
What  I  learned  is  I  needed  to  have  small  dip  projects that  paid bills that  over  
time  gave  me  a  platform to  do  bigger  dip  projects.  See  what  I’m getting  at?   
When  I  got  in  the  Internet  space  I  realized  for  a  long  time  I  could  get  it  funded   
because  AOL  would  pay  me  money,  CompuServe  would  pay  me  money,  or  Prodigy  
would  pay  me  money  to  build  for  them.  I  used  that  profit  to  build  my  web  thing.   
But again it wasn’t this  one  long three-­‐year dip where I wasn’t  going to get  paid  
for two and half years. That  kind of project, that’s like an architect  building his own  
house  with  his  own  hammer,  and  he  has  to  drive  to  Maine  every  time  he  wants  to  go   
to  work. That doesn’t work.    
So  you  have  to  make  sure  there’s  alignment  between  your  resources,  your   
customers,  and  how  big  the  dip  is.

**BUILDING THE  TRUTH **  
**The Right  Medium **  
We  need  to  understand  that  you  need  to  have  the  right  thing  that  matches  the  right   
medium.   
If  you’re  going  to  open  a  store  in  a  mall  you  shouldn’t  sell  cars  because  people   
don’t  buy  cars  when  they  go  to  the  mall.  If  you’re  going  to  sell  snacks  at  the  stadium  
you should sell  peanuts and popcorn because people walk  in expecting peanuts and  
popcorn.    
When Jeff  Bezos  and  his  wife  left New York and  drove  to  Seattle, he  sat in the  car   
and  made  a  long  list  of  all  the  things  he  could  sell  at  Amazon.  The list  included  
music,  shoes,  books,  lots  of  things.  But  what  he  said  is,  “For  it  to  sell  online,  One,  it   
needs  to  be  something  where  you  don’t  have  to  touch  it  to  know  if  it’s  the  thing.”  So   
you  can’t  sell  bananas  because  bananas  vary  too  much,  whereas  every copy of  
Catcher in  the Rye is what  you  expect.   
Number  two,  “It  needs  to  have  a  huge  variety  because  if  I’m going  to  be  the  best   
in  the  world,  I  want  to  be  the  best  in  the  world  because  I  have  every  item that’s  for   
sale  as  opposed  to  some.  I  can  defeat any  store  because  I’ll have  all the  stuff.”   
Number  three,  “There  needs  to  be  a  way  for  me  to  price  it  so  that  the  customer   
knows  they’re  getting  a  discount.”  A discount  because  he  was  going  to  run  a  low  cost   
operation  and  the  model  was  you  were  going  to  give up the satisfaction of touching  
it  and the gratification of getting it  right  now  in exchange for variety and discount.   
When  you  go  down  that  list,  books  become  an  obvious  choice  because  there’s   
basically  an  infinite  number  of  books  and  no  store  could  carry  them all,  every  book   
has a  list  price, it’s easy to understand how  to deal  with discounts, and you get   
unlimited  returns  back  to  the  book  publisher  so  there’s  no  risk.  That’s  how  he   
figured out  how  to sell  books online.    
When people  run around  and  say, “No, no, no. We’re going to sell  fruit  online  
because  it  would  be  just  like  Amazon.”  Well  actually  no  it  won’t.  It  won’t  be  anything   
like  Amazon.  All  the  advantages  Amazon  have  does  not  exist  if  you’re  selling  fruit.   
That’s the first  thing—think about which  place  you want to  sell. What is  a  
natural  thing  of  what  that  medium is  good  at?   
Number  two  is  remembering  that  the  heart  of  all  transactions  is  trust.  I’m more   
likely  to  trust  a  store  I’m standing  in  where  I  can  see  the  item and  take  it  with  me   
when I  leave  than  I  am to  trust  a  website  that  might  just  be  ripping  me  off.   
When you’re  saying, “Where  should  I sell it?” a lot of  it depends  on what you’re   
selling. If you’re selling a  service, if you’re a  psychologist  and you  say, “You  know   
   
111   

* * *

   
   
what,  for  10  minutes  a  day  I  can  help  you  perform better.”  There’s  a  couple  ways   
you could sell  it.   
You could  set up a table  in Union Square  with  a little  sign over  it and  people   
could pay you $5 on the spot.    
You  could  have  a  traditional  office  in  a  traditional  medical  building and  be just  
like  every  other  psychologist except your  sessions  are  really  short.    
Or  you could  have  a website  where  people  click a button and  you answer  the   
phone  and  you  talk  to  them and  they  never  look  you  in  the  eye.   
Each  one  of  them could  work  for  a different reason, but you have to understand   
the  transactions  are  going  to  be  fundamentally  different  because  our  trust  is  going   
to  be  fundamentally  different.   
If  it’s  the online site it better  be free at first. Because why on earth would   
someone  pay  $50  so  they  could  press  a  button  and  a  stranger  could  talk  to  them on   
the  computer?  This  is  not  going  to  happen.  Whereas  if  I  do  it  three  times  and  I’m  
hooked,  then  maybe  you  could  charge  me.   
Whereas  if  it’s  in your  fancy  office  and  you’re  trying to  project  you’re a  real   
psychologist,  the  thought  that  the  sessions  are  free  would  wreck  my  trust  in  you.  No   
psychologist  would  offer  me  a  free  session  in  her  office  if  she  were  any  good.  So   
we’re  trying  to  match  one  to  the  other.   
An  absurd  way  to  look  at  this is if we go to New  York  and look  at  fashion week   
where  they  have  all  those  anorexic  models  walking  up  and  down  in  all  those  clothes   
no one will every buy. Why are they doing that?   
They’re  doing  that  charade  because  the  people  in  the  front  row  came  to  see  a  
show. Fashion designers understand if they put  on a  show  then the people in the  
second row  who are the buyers for the stores will  say, “Oh this guy knows how  to  
put  on  a  show,  I’ll  buy  his  regular  line  for  my  fall  lineup.”   
Whereas  if  you say, “No, no  I’m just  a  good  designer.  I’m going  to  skip  fashion   
week.  I’m not  going  to  pay  the  tax  to  be  there,”  Bloomingdales  isn’t  going  to  call  you   
because  you weren’t willing to  put on a show.   
These  are  all  complicated  pieces  that  fit  into,  “What  story  are  you  telling and   
how  are you building the truth?”   
**Letting Go **  
When  I  was  building  my  company  I  believed  that  one-­‐day I’d hire enough people  
that  they  could  take  care  of  themselves.  Because  if  you  hire  managers  and  you  think,   
“Now  they  can  take  care  of…”  But  then  the  managers  need  taking  care  of.  At  70   
people  I  gave  up.  I  said  I’m never  going  to  get  there.   
   
112   

* * *

   
   
Then  I  got  to  Yahoo  and  the  five  people  who  were  running  the  company  didn’t   
have  to  do  any  of  that.  They  built  their  company  big  enough  that  it  took  care  of  itself.    
If  you  think  about  the  Howard  Schultz  example—the  mom and  pop—“Well he’s   
not  in  this  store,  he  must  be  in  this  store  so  this  store’s  running  fine…”  Once  you   
have  enough  stores,  you  can’t  be  in  any  store;  the  stores  are  running  fine.  At  some   
point you’re going to need to hire a  COO.    
At  some  point  you’re  going  to  need  to  hire  a  consigliere  who  takes  care  of  all  of   
this  and  that’s  their  job.  Their  job  is  for  them to  do  the  stuff  you  don’t  want  to  do.   
And  the  way  I  describe  it  is  this:   
Entrepreneurs  hire people who do everything they do so they can go do  
something  else.   
**The  only  way  to  promote  yourself  if  you’re  the  boss  is   
to  hire  someone  who  does  your  day  job  so  that you   
now  have  to  prove  your  value  by  doing something**  
**that use  to  be  your  day  job. **  
There  are people capable of  doing the taxes, the relationships  with the banks,  
and  everything else  better  than you. It’s  about you giving up enough  control,  
spending  the  money,  and  saying,  “I’m done  with  this.”  The  only  way  you  justify  it  is   
to  earn  more  than  that  amount  of  money  with  the  time  you  freed  up.  But  it’s  a   
choice. There’s nothing built  into the structure of your business that  forces you to do  
stuff you  don’t  want. It’s hard to get  to let  go of it.    
I’ve  tried  to  discipline  myself  to  do  that.  I  don’t  go  to  meetings,  I  don’t  look  at   
bills  and  invoices,  and  I  don’t  have  a  relationship  with  any  bank  because  somebody   
else  does  that.  I  don’t  even  see  her.  She  comes  in  my  office  once  a  month.  She  has  a   
basket and  I put stuff  in the  basket and  then it goes  away.  But  I’ve  known  Ann  for   
15-­‐20 years. We trust  each other and it  works. Does she do it  exactly the way I  want   
every  time?  No,  but  that’s  the  price.  I  don’t  have  to  worry  about  it.  In  exchange,  she   
doesn’t  do it  exactly the way I  want  it, but  she does it  better.   
**Hiring a  Chief  Financial  Officer  (CFO)  &  Chief  Operating Officer  (COO) **  
My  experience  is  this.  Number  one,  a  CFO  is  different  than  a  COO.   
A CFO  is  not  a  glorified  bookkeeper.  A CFO  is  in  charge  of  thinking  about  money.   
A CFO  for  a  public  company  is  _way_ different  than  a  CFO  for  a  private  company.  Do   
not  hire  a  public  company  CFO  to  come  work  for  your  little  private  company.  They   
will  drive  you  crazy.  But  if  you  can  find  someone  who  is  ready  to  think  about  money   
and  rationalize  the  money,  you  do  that  first.  It’s  much  easier  to  hire  a  part  time  CFO.   
It’s  much  easier  to  say,  “Ok  now  the  money  is  taken  care  of.”   
   
113   

* * *

   
   
Then  you  can  go  find  a  COO  and  say  to  that  person,  “The  money  is  taken  care  of.   
The  marketing  is  my  job.  You’re  job  is  using  the  money  you’ve  got  and  the  promises   
I’m making—make  the  promises  come  true.”   
Then you say to that  person, “I work  for you.”—Meaning  if  I  made  promises  you   
can’t  keep,  you  need  to  be  able  to  tell  me  I  can’t  do  that.  And  if  you  need  more   
resources  to  keep  the  promises  I’m making,  you  need  to  tell  me  that  you’re  taking   
the  resources.” That’s  the  only  way  they  can have  the  ‘C’ in COO, otherwise  they’re   
just  going  to  become  your  admin.   
At  first  they  will  not  be  one  tenth  as  good  at  this  as  you  are.  They  will  not   
understand  the  smart  shortcuts.  They  will  not  understand  the  right  quality  choices.   
Everything  they  make  will  cost  more  then  you  think  it  should.  But  if  you’re  serious   
about  getting  rid  of  this  stuff  and  you  want  them to  run  the  army  while  you  figure   
out  the strategy, you’re going to have to do that.    
And  the  first  person,  the  second  person,  and  the  third  person  might  not  be  the   
right  one  which  is  why  a  part  time  project  manager  might  be  exactly  what  you  want.   
You  say  to  this  project  manager,  “This  one  client  is  yours.  Tell  me  the  resources   
you need. You’re the Chief Project  Manager for this client.”   
If  they  nail  it,  you  give  them a  second  one  and  a  third  one.  You  keep  giving  them  
new clients until they’re full and they will have worked their  way up and you will  
develop  the shorthand.    
I  had  one  woman  who  worked  for  me  as  a  COO  and  then  I  made  her  the   
president  of  Yoyodyne  and  it  was  fabulous.  The  first  month  I  felt  like  one  of  those   
trust  exercises  where  you  lean  back  and  there  was  no  one  there.  And  I  just  kept   
leaning back  and  I  just  let  projects  fail  and  I  said,  “I  mean  it,  GO!”   
After  two  or  three  weeks  she  just  ran.  The  last  two  months  before  we  sold  the   
company  no  one  woke  me  up  in  the  middle  of  the  night  and  things  worked  better   
than I ever  could  have.    
It was  because  I  said,  “I’m not  in  that  business  anymore,  you’re  in  that  business.   
They  work  for  you.  Figure  it  out.  And  I  know  it’s  going  to  cost  more.  I  know  it’s  going   
to  take  longer,  but  soon  you’ll  be  better  at  it  than  me.”  And  it’s  usually  the   
entrepreneur who sabotages  it  by  hiring  the  wrong  person  or  by  not  giving  them the   
trust that they  need.    
**Advisory  Boards **  
You can call it an advisory board. You can call it a board. You can call it an advisory  
committee.  By  law,  every  corporation  has  a  board  and  the  board  is actually  
representative of the shareholders and the board is the boss.   
If  you  have  a  bad  board,  you’re  life  is  miserable.  You  have  to  be  very  careful   
about what is  its  function and  who  picked  those  people. If  you’re  really self-­‐  
   
114   

* * *

   
   
disciplined, you  don’t  need a  board to tell  you what  to do. On the other hand, if you  
do  want  to  act  exactly  the  way  the  system wants  a  board  can  be  a  very  useful  tool  to   
keep you in line.    
If  I’m going  to  invest  in  Facebook,  I  care  a  great  deal  about  who’s  on  the  board   
because  I  know  they  have  a  mad  scientist  who’s  running  the  company,  but  as  an   
investor  the  boards’  job  is  to  look  out  for  me.  That’s  a  tough  decision.   
That’s really different  than  a  board  of  advisors.  A board  of  advisors  has  two   
functions.  One,  to  give  you  advice  and  two,  making  you  look  good  to  other  people.   
You should  be  really clear  with  yourself  and  the  board  which  one  they are.    
If  I blurb a book for  an author, the only reason  the  author  asked  me  to  do  it  is  so   
they  would  look good  to  other  people. We  both  know that. We  both  know that it is   
not  my  job  to  field  complaints  from the  readers  if  they’re  unhappy  with  the  book   
just  because  I  put  my  name  on  the  back.  That’s  not  part  of the deal.   
If  you  go  to  the  Mayor  of  Charlotte  and  say,  “Will  you  be  on  my  advisory  board?”   
What  you’re  really  saying  is,  “May  I  drop  your  name  when  I  go  to  meetings?”  You   
should be really clear that  that’s what’s on offer. If people say yes to it, you should   
make  a  big  deal  out  of  your  advisory  board  otherwise  don’t  bother  having  one.   
The other alternative, is there a  group of people who will  tell  you the truth?  In  
that  case  the  question  is,  should  they  meet  as  a  group  and  should  they  be  famous?   
“Should  they  meet  as  a  group?”  is  interesting  because  groupthink  kicks  in  almost   
immediately.  I’m not  a  fan  of  meetings  whatsoever,  but  if  you  have  eight  people  in   
the  room,  many  with  reputations,  they’re  not  having  a  meeting  where  they  actually   
are  giving you  candid  feedback  about  your  goals  and  your  dreams.  They’re  worried   
about,  “How  does  this  look?  How  does  this  make  me  look?  What  does  this  person   
over  there  think  about  what  I  just  said?”  None  of  that  is  how  you  want  to  manage   
your  life.  At  least  I  think  so.    
In  those  situations  I  would  say,  “I  want  to  meet  with  you  for  lunch  once  a  month.   
I’m going  to  bring  you  my  three  biggest  problems.  I’m going  to  make  three  promises   
to  you.  When  I  come  back  next  month,  I  want  you  to  ask  me  about  the  three   
promises  I  made  to  you.  I  want  you  to  help  me  with  three  more  problems  and  in   
exchange  the  Cobb  salad  is  on  me.”  If  you  got  three  people  in  your  life  like  that,  you   
win the  lottery. That’s  fabulous—at least the  way I’ve  approached  this.    
Again  you  have  to  decide  what  is it’s role and what’s it  for. If you  end up  with  
employees,  this  gets  really  tricky.   
At  the  Acumen  Fund  I’m pretty  active.  Jacqueline,  to  her  credit,  likes  it  when  I   
talk  to  her  employees.  And  I  say  absolutely  amazing  over the top  ridiculous  
proposals:  “And  go  try  this,  maybe  you’ll  fail…”    
   
115   

* * *

   
   
Now  if  I  was  runny  a  company,  I’m not  sure  I’d  want  somebody  coming  in   
pretending  they  have  my  imprimatur  just  telling  my  employees  to  do  whatever  the   
hell  that  person  thought  of  on  their  way  over.  But  maybe  you  do.   
So again, you figure out  what  you want  the relationship to be between this  
advisor  / public thing and  the  work you’re  actually doing.    
And  the  last  part  in  your  particular  case  is  I  think  because  your  whole  foundation   
is  in  the  community,  I  would  find  30  or  40  people who aren’t advisors, but who are  
actually on the  hook, publically, to  execute.    
You say to  that person, “I want you to  sell a table  at this  Gala,” but it’s  the   
equivalent  of that  online.  Because  when  someone’s  on  the  hook  to sell  a  table, they  
sell  the  table.  They  rather  sell  the  table,  buy  the  tickets  themselves  if  they  have  to,   
than  admit  they  failed.   
That’s really different  than saying, “We support  the Gala.”   
So,  what  is  the  equivalent  of,  “Can  I  put  your  name  on  the  invitation?  Can  I  mark   
you off for bringing 10 other influential  people in?  That’s the first  thing I would do  
when I got back to  Charlotte.

**THE  SHIPIT JOURNAL  **  
All  right  so  the  next  thing  I  have  in  here  is  the  fabled  out  of  print  ShipIt  Journal.  Do   
not look ahead please  when  you  open  them up.   
This  comes  in  a  five  pack  for  a  reason  and  the  reason  was  I  wanted  people  to  buy   
five  at  a  time.  And  the  reason  you  needed  to  buy  five  at  a  time  was  you  needed  to  do   
this  with  everyone  on  the  team at  the  same  time.   
Everyone on  the  team gets  one  of  these  and  it  has  to  be  in  print.  There’s  a  digital   
version, but  I didn’t  do the digital  version initially because I knew  people would look   
ahead  and  say, “Oh. Ok. I get it,” and  put it away.    
It’s  very  important  that  it  involves  pen  and paper  because people act differently  
when  they  have  to  write  something  down.  This  goes  right  to  this  idea  of  the  dip.  If   
you fill  this out  in pen all  the way to the end, I guarantee you will  ship your project.    
If  you don’t care enough to ship your  project, don’t  fill  this out. But  if you do fill  it   
out  and  tell  the  truth  on  every  page,  you  will  ship  your  project.  Sit  with  a  team of   
three, four, or  five  people  and  have  an honest discussion about whether  people  are   
willing to  write  this  down. It takes  about an hour.   
We’re  not going to  do  the  whole  thing today, but The  ShipIt Journal is  to   
understand  what the dip is. Because you could  quit that day if  you want. You can fire  
people  that  day  if  you  want.  You  can  move  on  or  you  can  say,  “We’re  going  to  do  this   
because  we’re  gonna ship the  thing.”   
We’re  going  to  have  an  aside  here  because  its  relevant  to  something  later  in  the   
book,  but  let  me  talk  about  it  now.   
A guy  name  Steve  McConnell  worked  at  Microsoft  for  years  and  years  and  he   
could not  understand how  an  organization  as  smart  as  Microsoft  so  often  missed   
ship  dates for software and how  expensive it  was. What  tends to happen is this:    
The first  edition of software—Excel 1.0, Word  1.0—tends  to  be  built by  two   
people. It tends  to get out the door  ahead  of  schedule and work  ok.    
The  second  version  of  a  piece  of  software  is  almost  always  a  disaster  because  it   
gets  loaded  up  with  features  and  the  management  of  the  whole  process  is  bad.   
And  the  third  version  of  a  piece  of  software  tends  to  take  100  times  as  many   
people  to  build  as  the  first  version.  And  it’s  not  just  software;  it’s  fancy  office   
buildings  and  everything else.   
Here’s what  we understand is the reason.   
**Thrash  in  the  Beginning  **  
   
117   

* * *

   
   
When you’re  working on a significant project a couple  people  are  involved  in  
iterating  about  it,  brainstorming  about  it,  going  back  and  forth.  If  you  think  about   
your  projects,  it’s  two  or  three  people  at  the  most.  But  then  it  gets  sort  of  interesting   
and  I’ll  use  a  corporate  example  first.   
A vice  president  gets  involved  and  a  couple  other  people  on  corporate.  They   
have  more  ideas.  Maybe  there’s  a  focus  group  or  two.  The  amount  of  variation,  what   
Steve calls ‘thrashing,’ happens.    
Meanwhile  this  is  time  \[X-­‐Axis\]  and  this  is  ship  date  right  here  \[Y-­‐Axis\].  Well  it’s   
working  really  well,  so  now  you  have  to  bring  in  the  marketing  guys  because  you’re   
going  to  be  spending  a  lot  of  time  launching  it  and  some  sales  people  and  they  have   
a very different idea.    
Now  the  programmers  say,  “We  have  to  rebuild  the  database,”  and  the   
salespeople  say,  “That  means  the  price  is  going  to  have  to  be  higher,”  and  the   
marketing  people  say,  “That  means  I  need  a  bigger  budget.”   
At  this  point,  \[Steve\]  Ballmer  comes  in.   
Now  there are  more  meetings  and  the  project  is  almost  cancelled  because  it’s   
getting  closes  to  being  behind  schedule.  They  look  at  how  much  money  they’ve   
spent  so  far  and  it’s  going  way  up.  At  this  point  they  go  one  more  cycle  and  they’re   
about to  launch  and  then the  corporate lawyers are invited in for one last  look  just   
to  make  sure.  Then  they  have  to  rewrite  the  source  code.  And  you  miss  your  date.   
Changes to buildings,  software,  and projects at  this level  \[towards the end\]  are  
inanely,  insanely  expensive  compared  to  here  \[the  beginning\]  where  they’re  almost   
free.  For  you  to  change  your  business  model  here  \[the  beginning\]  it  costs  you  a   
nickel. If you want to change it the day before you launch, you got big trouble.    
So  Steve’s  \[McConnell\]  answer  is  really  simple.  Thrash at  the beginning and then  
keep taking people  off  the  project until you launch.    
It’s  really  easy  to  look  at  this  and  say  that’s  impossible,  but  it’s  not  impossible.  In   
fact, that’s the only way to do it. When it’s cheap  and it’s just  in the paper planning  
stage, that’s when every person who has to approve it  has to show  up.    
When  it’s  over  here  \[towards  the  end\],  Steve  Ballmer  is  not  allowed  in  the   
building because  Steve  already  approved  it when he  saw the  PowerPoint version of   
the  layout here. Too  late  Steve.  You  don’t  get  to  tell  us  you  want  to  move  the  save   
and  exit button around. Not allowed.   
When  I  had  my  first  real  job,  my  only  real  job  at  Spinnaker,  the  president  of  the   
company  was  a  great  guy  and  I  was  in  charge  of  a  whole  bunch  of  projects.  If  I   
missed  the  date  by  even  one  day,  the  company—all  100  employees—would  go   
bankrupt.  And  I  had  learned  from working  with  him that  he  was  really  busy  and  like   
Ballmer,  but  with  better  taste,  he  would  show  up  at  the  last  possible  minute  to  play   
   
118

the  game  (we  made  computer  games)  and  give  us  really  valuable  feedback  when  it   
was  too  late.    
So I had these five  products  I  had  to  get  out.  I  had  a  year  to  get  them out  and  we   
had just  finished the scripts. The scripts had every word that  was going to appear on  
every  screen.  We  had  the  pictures,  the  art  mostly  done.  We  had  some  sound  done.   
These were the first  computer  adventure  games  that  had  pictures  and  sound.   
I  walked  into  David’s  office  and  said,  “Here  are  the  five  scripts.  Here’s  the  sample   
pictures.  Here  are  the  sound  files.  And  here’s  a  piece  of  paper.  What the  piece  of   
paper  says  is:  I David  Seuss, if  the  software has  this  script and  the software uses   
these  images  and  the  sound  sounds  like  this  will  approve  the  game  when  it’s  done.”   
I  said  to  David,  “You  can  take  as  long  as  you  want  to  read  these  scripts.  And  you   
can take as long as you want  to look  at  these  pictures.  But  you  see  that  team out   
there  of  seven people;  no  one  is  going to  work on anything until you sign this  piece   
of  paper.  But  once  you  sign  the  piece  of  paper,  you  may  not  comment  on  a  word  in   
the  script  and  you  may  not  comment  on  the  music  or  the way the graphics  look  
because  I’m showing  you  them today.”  I  was  24.   
And  he  looked  at  me  in  his  great  laugh  and  he  so  respected  why  I  was  doing  this   
that  he  laughed,  smiled,  and  signed  the  piece  of  paper.  He  never  bothered  us  again.   
  That’s  the only reason  we  made  our  date.  It’s  because  I  kept  that  piece  of  paper.   
I  wish  I  had  it  to  this  day.  If  anyone  said,  “What  about…”  and  I  say,  “Sorry  it’s  already   
approved. We  can’t change  that.”    
The  same  thing’s  true  if  your  renovating  the  supermarket  down  the  street and   
you  just  see  the  number  of  tradesmen  going  up  who  are  there,  but  the  number  of   
people  who  get  to  make  decisions  about  architecture  keeps  going  down  because   
they’re  not allowed  to  be  there.    
**Filling Out  the ShipIt  Journal **  
Now  to the ShipIt  Journal. Let’s go to the first page with blanks in it. What I tried to  
do are  force  people  to  demonstrate  precision  and  intent  about  a  project.   
The first  question is,    
_**“What exactly  is  this  project?”**_   
It  can’t  be  vague  because  vague  things  are  not  manageable,  finite,  time  dated,   
doable, or fallible.    
It’s  only a project if  you can say, “We failed.”    
It’s  only a project if  you can say, “It’s  done.”

Facebook  is  not  a  project.  A project  is  adding  comments  to  picture  pages.  That’s  a   
project.    
Then you have to pick  as group  a  date  and  a  time  on  that  date  when  it  will  be   
done.  Not  when  it  will  approximately  be  done,  but  when  it  will  be  _done_  _done_.  And  if   
you  can’t  pick  a  date,  you  don’t  have  a  project.  Don’t  have  this  meeting.  Go  back.   
Figure out  what  you  need to so you  can  have  this  meeting.   
The next  page is,    
_**“Give me the name of one person  who  is  in  charge of making  this   
date  happen.”**_   
There are other people who work  on the project. That’s fine. You can divide the  
tasks  into  multiple  projects.  That’s  fine.  But  it’s  not  a  project  unless  one  human   
being  is  responsible  for  getting  it  to  ship  on  time.  By  definition  that  person  gets  to   
tell  everybody  else  what  has  to  happen  for  it  to  ship  on  time.   
One  of  the  things  we  did  at  Spinnakker  in  order  for  us  to  make  a  thing  at  the  end,  
(we  had  60  or  50  people  working  on  it  full  time)  is  I  had  a  bunch  of  buttons  made.   
Some  were  green.  Some  were  red.  If  you  were  on  the  critical  path  to  get  this  thing   
out  the door, you had a  green button. If you weren’t, you had a  red button. The deal   
was  if  the  person  with  the  green  button  needed  something  from a  person  with  a  red   
button they  got it.    
If  you were in accounting and  you had  a red  button on and  the person with a  
green  button  on  need  you  to  play  test  the  game  for  20  minutes  to  test  a  little  section  
of  it  or  we’d  miss  the  deadline,  the  person  in  accounting  had  to  stop  what  they  were   
doing and help  the person in the play testing division by testing the section of the  
game.   
If  you’re serious  about shipping the project that’s  what you’re going to do. Right?   
Otherwise  you’re  not  serious;  so  don’t  complain  when  you  don’t  ship  it.   
Now  we get  right  into the nitty gritty about  telling ourselves the truth of what   
we’re  afraid  of.    
One  of  the  things  we’re  afraid  of  is  not  making  the  date.  Ok  I  get  that. But there  
are  all these  other  things  we’re  afraid  of  which  is  why we  delay things, look at things   
the  last  minute,  and  make  changes.   
We’re  afraid  of  being  made  fun  of,  getting  bad  reviews  on  Amazon,  not  selling,   
not getting picked up, people thinking it’s  too  this  or  too  that.  All  these  emotions   
need to be brought up early so we can be really clear  about what this is and what it’s  
for as a  project.    
Along  the  way  to  get  this  thing  to  ship  we’re  going  to  have  to  make  compromises.   
This next  page    
   
120   

* * *

   
   
_**“Pick  some  edges”**_  is  about  compromises.  Some  of  the  things  you’re  doing   
you’re  just  not  willing  to  compromise  on.   
Zappos  is  not  willing  to  compromise  saving  money  on  how  long  they’re  willing  to   
spend  on  the  phone  with  a  customer.  Are  they  willing  to  save  money  on how  thick   
the  cardboard  is  they  use  to  box  up  the  shoes?  Absolutely.  If  they  can  save  money  by   
using thinner  cardboard  it doesn’t affect what their  business  is  all about.    
You  have  to  highlight  here  what  the  edges  your  company  /  project  stands  for  and   
which  ones  don’t  you  care  about.  What  that  means  is  if  it  comes  down  to  a   
compromise,  to  make  the  budget  or  make  the  time,  you  say,  “I’m not  compromising   
that  one,  but  I  will  compromise  this  one,”  because  you’re  not  going  to  have   
everything.    
Let’s say the reason  we’re building  this flashlight  is because this is going  to be  
the  most  durable  flashlight  ever  made.  This  flashlight  is  going  to  be  waterproof,   
sunproof,  shockproof,  etc.  Then  they  come  to  you  and  there  are  six  weeks  left  before   
the  deadline  and  they  say,  “Tara  we  got  a  problem.  The  titanium shipments  aren’t   
going  to  be  coming  in  on  time  unless  we  pay  an  extra  $10,000,  but  we  can  substitute   
aluminum.”   
You  say,  “Why?  Are  we  doing  that  because  we’re  going  to  make  it  cheaper  or   
what’s  the  impact  of  that?”    
They  say,  “Well  the  problem is  it’s  going  to  make  it  a  lot  less  durable.”   
You  say,  “The  whole  reason  we  made  it  was  to  make  it  durable.  Pay  the  money.”   
  Whereas  if  they say, “It’s  going to change the price,” you say, “I don’t care. We’re  
in the durable  business.  We’re  not  in  the  cheap  business.”  That’s  what  I’m getting  at.   
Ok next page.    
_**“Who  are we trying  to  please?  Who  is  our  customer?”**_   
Again,  this  is  where  so  many  projects  get  stuck.  None  of  these  projects  have  to  do   
with  the  laws  of  physics. They  have to do with taste. They have to do with  
compromise.   
Someone  comes  into  the  office  and  says,  “You  know,  I  was  talking  to  my  mom.   
She didn’t understand the tag lines on all our  sell pages. I think we need to redo  
them.”   
You need  to  go  down this  list and  see  where  this  person’s  mom is  on  the  list.  And   
if  you’re  not  trying  to  please  her,  you  don’t  try  to  please  her.  It’s  that  simple.   
If  you’re talking about helping an author  with a Kickstarter  and  the author   
decides she doesn’t  like the fourth level  prize, you say, “But  your readers love the  
fourth level  prize.”  If you’ve done this—_who’s  it  for?_  Is  it for  the author  or  is  it for  the  
   
121   

* * *

   
   
readers?  When  possible do both,  but  when  it’s not  possible,  _who’s  it  for?_  Important   
to  understand.    
Jumping  ahead  a  little  bit.    
_**“Questions  and  ideas  for  the devil’s  advocate.”**_   
I  know  a  guy  in  publishing,  who  every  meeting  I  have  with  him even  after  I’ve   
written  a  blog  post  about  this  that  he  read,  can’t  help  himself.  He  says,  “Let  me  play   
devil’s advocate here for a  second,”  and  then  explains  why  some  idea  I’m going  to  do   
isn’t  going  to  work.  And  every  time  Will  says  it  I  say,  “The  devil’s  doing  fine.  He   
doesn’t  need  an  advocate.”  And  every  time  Will  says,  “Yeah.  I  know.”  Because  he   
doesn’t  think  about  when he says his expression.   
So this is a list of all the reasons that people are going to give you about why  
your project  isn’t  going to work  and you just  have to say, “Oh, it’s already written  
down in the book. We don’t  have to have a  discussion about  any of these reasons  
because  I  already  read  them all.”  I  put  that  down  there  to  make  it  easier  for  you   
Then particularly with internal  projects, but  also projects where there is a  board of  
health or whatever,    
_**“Who  can  stop  it?”**_   
Who  can say, “I do  not approve  of  this. You’re  not allowed  to  do  this.  I  am  
stopping  you  from doing  this.”  Those  people,  by  definition,  have  a  real  say  in   
whatever  compromises  you’re  going  to  make  to  get  this  thing  out  the  door.   
The next  page is the opposite of that,  which is,    
_**“Who  are the people who  are essential  to us making this thing**_  
_**work?  Who  are  the  people  I  have  to  court,  engage  with,  or  satisfy   
because  their  contribution will  make  the  project  a  project.”**_   
Now  we  get  to  my  favorite  sneak  question.  On  the  next  page  it  says,   
_**“What does  perfect look  like?”**_   
I would  like you to list when your  project is  working perfectly.    
Exactly what is  it?    
What kind  of  profit does  it have?    
Who  loves  it?    
What shape  is  it?    
What color  is  it?    
   
122   

* * *

   
   
What do  the  reviews  say?    
Whatever  is  important  to  you  about  perfect,  this  is  the  page  where  you  write   
down what  it’s like when it  is perfect.    
But then the  next page  says,    
**“What does good  enough  look  like?”**  And  _“good  enough”_  probably  
shouldn’t  be  the  same  as  perfect.   
The definition  of  “good  enough”  is  good  enough.  Perfect  is  the  enemy  of  good.   
It  is  better  to  ship  something  that’s  good  enough  because  you  told  me  what  _good _  
_enough_  was  than to ship nothing.    
You  need  to  be  really  clear  with  the  team if  they  get  four  gold  stars  by  making  
something  perfect,  but  they  also  get  gold  stars  by  making  something  _good  enough_.  
Because  we’re  all  in  the  business  of  making  things  that  are  _good  enough._  Even if  you  
want,  you  can  make  _good  enough_  really close to perfect, but there is  a difference.    
You cannot be  in the  business  of  shipping on a regular  basis  if  perfect is  your   
only option because you just  don’t  get  perfect.    
Then  we  get  into  the  nitty  gritty.  And  you  can’t  fit  it  here.   
_**Every task,  every event  that  needs to happen—By  what  date?  By **_  
_**whom?**_    
The concrete needs to be delivered by this date and piled up right  here.    
The  tow  truck  needs  to  be  ready  to  move  this  item from here  to  here.   
This batch of code and this piece of art  need to be done by this date.   
You just exhaustively list every dependency and everything that  everyone has to  
do.  If  you  need  to,  you  make  those  into  mini  projects  with  mini  project  managers.   
It’s  here that the friction starts  to show up because “The concrete guy can’t do it  
because  he  didn’t get paid. He  didn’t get paid because the CFO  didn’t  authorize the  
payment.  The  CFO  didn’t  authorize  the  payment  because  the  form wasn’t  filled  out   
right.  The  form wasn’t  filled  out  right  because  this  guy…”  You  go  all  the  way  back   
and  you discover  that just because  one  person didn’t fill  out  one  form your  project  is   
going  to  be  a  month  late.   
The goal  on the first  day is to be really clear with everybody about  what  all  those  
dependencies are, rip  out  every dependency that’s there just  because it’s always  
been there, and  to  replace  them with  smaller  teams  with  more  responsibility.  That  is   
really critical.   
If  the  project  is  worth  doing,  it’s  worth  doing  with  a  smaller  team.

**Mapping Out  a  Project **  
_**Q: So what  I’m  having  trouble  visualizing  is  now  it’s  me—I’m  not  a  programmer   
and  so how  would  I  leverage  this  tool  right  now?  Or  does  this  come  once  I—is  
this  first  step  I  need  to amass  a  team  with  the  right…” **_  
No.  So  you  say,  “I’m going  to  need  programming.”  That’s  early  on.  There’s  a  place   
where  you’re  going to  list what’s  going to  be  a part  of  this  project.    
Then  you  call  Brian  at  VJ  labs  in  Maryland  and  say,  “Brian,  on  December  15th  I’m  
going  to  need  software  that  matches  this  approximate  spec.  For  you  to  make  that   
date, for you  to bet  your reputation on that  date, on what  date do you  need to  get  
from me  every  screenshot,  every  layout,  every  requirement?”  And  he  says  back  to   
you  September  1st.    
Suddenly  the  only  deadline  that  matters  if  you  really  want  to  ship  on  January   
15th  is  September  1st.  If  you  miss  September  1st, you’re never  going to  make  it  up  in   
volume.  You’re  never  going  to  make  it  up  later  on.  September  1st  is  the do or  die  
date.    
Then you go to your graphic designer and you say, “Mr. Graphic Designer, by  
September  1st  I  need  this.  What  do  you  need  from me  today  to  guarantee  your  entire   
reputation  that  on  September  1st  that I’ll have this?”    
If  he’s  any good  he’s  going to say, “I’ll tell you one thing I need, you’re not  
allowed  to  call  me  after  August  10th. Because if you  call  me  after  August  10th,  I’m  
going  to  have  to  drop  everything  and  do  something  new  and  then  I  can’t  make   
September  1st.”  You  say,  “Fine.  So  if  I  give  you  this,  this,  and  this  by  August  9th, you’re  
promising  on  September  1st  I’ll have that?”    
Now, you  can build slack  in which is a useful  thing to do. Don’t  tell  everyone  
you’re putting in a week  of buffer in-­‐between  them,  but  the  point  is  you’re  now   
being honest with  yourself. In fact to  get this  out on January  15th, you have to finalize  
everything  by  August 22nd  or  whatever  the date is.    
Somewhere  along  the  way  you  were  fibbing  to  yourself  and  it’s  not  going  to  ship   
on January 15th.  Rather  than  paying  all  these  overage  charges  to  race  like  a  maniac   
in  December,  you  better  say,  “I  either  need  to  make  a  smaller  project or  I need  to   
change  my  ship  date.”  That’s  what  I’m getting  at.   
When  you  move  the  thrashing  all  the  way  to  the  first  day,  that’s  what  goal  we’re   
trying to  do  with  all of  this.    
So  when  Brian  at  VJ  Labs  says,  “I  don’t  want  to  get  a  call  from the graphic  
designer  after  September  1st,”  you  just  moved  graphic  thrashing  all  the  way  over   
here,  which  is  where  every  other  organization  would  be  looking  for  the  first  time  on   
November  10th  at  what  Brian  showed  them.

The way we built  Squidoo is we gave him  every single screenshot and  we never   
called  him once.   
And  then  he  calls  us  up  and  says,  “Done.”   
We  say, “Here’s  your  check. Thank You.”    
He said,  “That  has never happened to us once in  doing  150 websites.”  Because  
they  make  all  their  profit  on  the  changes.    
He’s  like,  “We  were  happy  to  work  with  you,  but  we  didn’t  make  any  money   
because  you didn’t bother  us.”    
And  they  were  on  time  and  so  were  we.   
**Your Minimal Viable  Product  (MVP) **  
Ok  so  the  Lean  thing,  and  I  am no  expert  on  it  at  all,  involves  a  post  industrial   
thinking  about  code,  which  is  that  code  is  soft,  code  is  malleable,  and  if  you  break  it   
into  small  building  blocks,  changes  won’t  kill  us.  The  thought  is  build  the  minimal   
viable product.    
Most  people  don’t  understand  the  word  minimal  or  viable.  It’s  something  people   
can actually use. Figure out  what’s working. Evolve. Go to the next  thing, go to the  
next  thing,  go  to  the  next  thing.  And  finally  because  the  coder  is  sitting  right  next  to   
the  marketing  person  and  you’re  doing  this  as  a  team,  the  thing that launches into  
the  world  is  cheaper  and  faster  and  more  agile  than  if  you  did  it  the  top  down   
industrial  way.   
Eric  would  disagree  with  me  about  how  to  do  this.  He’s  saying  thrash  from the   
beginning  to  the  end  and  just  keep  thrashing.  Always  be  shipping.  Always  be  in  beta.   
Always  figure  out  what’s  working.   
I’m more  old  school  than  that  because  I  think  lots  of  things  in  life  aren’t  involving   
software.  I  also  think  if  you  understate  what  viable  is,  you  will  launch  something   
that has  no  chance  to  capture  hearts  and  minds.  If  it  doesn’t  capture  hearts  and   
minds,  you’re  not  going  to  extract  the  value  you  really  need.  And  in  a  market  that   
increasingly  values  beauty  and  likes  the  reliability  that  comes  from connection,   
sometimes  that  approach  isn’t  going  to  work.   
On the  other  hand  at Threadless, two  of  the  guys  who  pioneered  this  whole  thing  
built a bad  version of  Threadless  then a slightly  less  bad  version, then a slightly  less   
bad  version,  and  now  they  are  a  $40  million  dollar  company.   
It definitely works.   
I just don’t think it’s  as  useful in lots  of  other  areas  of  our  lives  and  it can’t hurt to  
have these organizational  conversations even if you’re being agile. You never want   
someone  with  power  coming  in  at  the  end  and  telling  you  your  strategy  was  wrong.

One  way  engineers  do  that  is  they  say,  “It’s  1,000  micro  versions  of  the  software.   
Each  one  is  an  online  pitch  to  use  my  software.”   
I’m saying,  “It’s  a  100  small  projects,  where  project  number  one  is  come  with  a   
PowerPoint  that’s good enough so that  when  I have a sales  call I can show it to  
people asserting it’s  real and  see what they say.” That’s  a project, that first thing.   
A lot  of  you  came  in  here  thinking,  “No,  no.  I  need  to  finish  everything  and  make   
sure it’s perfect. Then I  can go on a  sales call.”    
Of  course  you’re  stuck  because  it’s  impossible  to  finish  everything.  It’s   
impossible  for  it  to  be  perfect  and  you  don’t  want  to  go  on  a  sales  call.  The  three  of   
those  put  together  means  you’re  going  to  be  planning  for  the  rest  of  your  life,  but   
you’re not  actually  interacting  with  the  market.  That  interaction  is  key.   
It’s  really worthwhile to take a step back and  figure out what’s  going to be hard   
about your  product.    
If  I  went  to  a  wedding  with  100  disposable  cameras  and  I  gave  them out  and   
then  two  days  later  everyone  who  was  at  the  wedding  got  an  Apple  printed  book   
created by 500 people filling in quotes in notebooks and taking pictures with a  
disposable  camera  and  then I said to those 100 people, “Want  to buy another one?”   
And  I  found  out  no  one  did,  that’s  a  version  of  a  minimal  viable  product  that  had  no   
software whatsoever involved. I  find out  if the book  itself is so electric that  people  
need  to  buy  more  of  them.   
Maybe  though  the  hard  part is  it just needs  to  be, “Can I find  people  who  will use   
it  online  and  contribute?”  And  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  analogs  in  the  real  world.   
If  that’s  the  thing  I’m testing,  a  minimal  viable  version  is  I  create  an  e-­‐mail   
address and I  publicize that  e-­‐mail  address  at  some  concert.   
“Everybody  send  me  your  pictures.”   
Everyone sends  in a picture to that e-­‐mail  address.  I  quickly  paste  something  up,   
make  it  a  Tumblr,  see  how  many  people  want  to  come  to  the  Tumblr, and  how  many   
people  want  to  comment  on  it—is  that  sort  of  thing  something  that  touches  them  
that they’re  excited  about?   
Again  these  are  ways  you  can  test  the  words  that  you  use  and  the  way  you   
promise  things  to  people.  Again  no  technology  was  used  whatsoever.   
One  of  the  magic  things  of  Yelp,  Facebook,  and  Ebay  is  they’re  digital  analogs  of   
things  that we  we’re  already  totally  into. They  didn’t invent a whole  new way  of   
human  beings  interacting.  This  is  a  slight  analog  of  something,  but  you’re   
supercharging it  because you  have digital  and everyone has the phone in their  
pocket.

The worst  case for your MVP is it  needs a  Martha  Stewart  flair, fit  and finish  
before  people  fall in love  with  it and  trust it. In which  case  you’re  MVP  is  your  final  
product.  And  that  happens  too.   
I would  argue that’s  what that travel website I saw at Techstars  Wander  is.  
Wander  only  works  because  it’s  unbelievably  beautiful. If  they  had  built a non-­‐  
beautiful version of  Wander, fail. No  one  cares  if  the  database  is  any  good. That’s   
easy to fix. But  they  needed  $1  million  dollars  to  make  Wander  beautiful.  That  might   
be  what you need.    
You’re  going to  have  to  figure  out what part is  going to  be  the  hard  part here  and   
that’s  going  to  come  from your  sense  of  hanging  out  with  the  kind  of  customer  you   
want.    
Last  thought  on  that.  The  web  is  a  big  place.  There  are  lots  of  kinds  of  customers   
on the web. What  we found out  at  Squidoo the hard way is that  high-­‐end fashionable  
people  like  Tumblr.  They  don’t  like  Squidoo.  Stay-­‐at-­‐home  moms  who  are  interested   
in Chameleons  and  Tattoos,  they  like  Squidoo.  So  we  ended  up  with  a  group  of   
people  we  didn’t  think  we’d  end  up  with  because  of  the  way  we  made  the  offer.   
The  minute  we  said,  “We  will  pay  you  a  royalty,”  we  got  a  totally  different  group   
of  people  then  Tumblr  which  gives  people  nothing.    
So  you  have  to  say,  “Am I  building  this  for  hipsters  in  the  East  Village  who  don’t   
go  to  the  High  Line  anymore  because  everyone  goes  or  am I  building  this  for  people   
who  are  going  to  the  big  family  wedding  in  Chicago?”  Totally  different  groups. You   
don’t  know  for which group  what  they want. You  have to pick, then you  can find out   
what they  want.   
Ok so  a couple  of  things  I want to  cover  here.    
_**“Who  becomes  your  competition?”**_ gets back to the fear.   
On the  day you launch  you now have  competition.   
On the  day you launch  you are  no  longer  with  a green screen behind  you. Its   
there  is  someone  just  like  us.   
You  need  to  say  out  loud,  “That  person  now  becomes  our  competition,”  because   
then you’ve  outlined  one  of  the  things  you’re  afraid  of.    
You turn the  page,    
_**“If this  doesn’t work  after  you  launch,  what’s  the worst that could **_  
_**happen? Really? The  worst  that  could happen?”**_   
I’ll  let  you  read  about  the  Bradman  Test  on  your  own.   
Then there’s

“_**Plusing  and  Minusing” **_  
Plusing  is  a  Disney  term.  What  Walt  Disney  used  to  do  as  movies  were  being   
made  is  he  would  say  to  the  animators,  “These  10  frames,  how  can  you  plus  them?   
How  can  we turn  it  up  to 11?  What  can  we add?  What  feature can  we add?”   
But  you  can  also  minus  stuff.  “What  can  we  take  away?  How  do we do less?  How   
do  we  make  a  smaller  offer?  How  do  we  say  we  don’t  do  that?”  There  are  two   
reasons  to  do  it:  one,  because  it  makes  it  more  likely  you’re  going  to  finish  your   
project.  And  two,  because  it  actually  makes  you  more  likely  that  you’ll  become  the   
best  in  the  world  at  something.   
Very few  people think  the buffets in  Las Vegas are the best  in  the world,  but  they  
have  everything.  We  would  much  rather  go  to  Shake  Shack  where  there’s  five  items   
than  go  to  some  place  where  there’s  5,000  items.   
At  some  point  when  you  say,  “We  have  everything,”  what  you’re  really  saying  is,   
“We  have  nothing.”   
I  think  there’s  an  interesting  conversation  we  had  about  yield  maximization,  but   
I’m way  more  interested  in  having  a  conversation  that  says,  “This  is  me,  this  is what   
I stand  for.”    
No we don’t  do that.    
We  do  not serve  children.    
We  not accept this.    
We  do  not have  that.    
We  are  a  nudist  colony  in  Mexico  for  fat  people  and  if  you’re  uncomfortable  with   
fat  people  don’t  come.  If  you’re  uncomfortable  with  nudist  don’t  come.  That’s  who   
we  are. That’s  what we  do.    
None  of  you,  not  one  I’ve  heard,  has  a  business  that’s  so  universal  and  so  magical   
that needs  to  be  this  is  for  everybody. It’s  not.    
If  you  start  with  “This  isn’t  for  you,”  it  makes  it  much  easier  to  be  remarkable.  It   
makes  it  much  easier  to  be  the  best  in  the  world  because  _it’s  not  for  you_.    
Then after it’s in the world and you have a  relationship and after you can talk  to  
people,  you  can  do  legitimate  testing  to  see  what  you  should  add  as  opposed  to   
seeing what you can take away.    
The  way  I  like  to  test  for  what  you  can  add  is  this,  and  I  learned  this  from Sony.   
Sony used to run focus groups and they would discover  people would say  
anything  in  a  focus  group  to  make  the  moderator  happy.  So  they’re  sitting  there  
trying to  test this  radio  they  were  going to  sell for  $49  and  at the  end  of  the  session  
   
128   

* * *

   
   
they  said  to  the  people  in  the  room,  “Thank  you  so  much  for  being  here.  As  a  gift   
we’d  either  like  to  give  you  $20  in  cash  or  the  radio.”  And  no  one  wanted  the  radio.  
There  you  go.  They  just  learned  something  really  important  about  the  radio.   
You say to  people, “We’re  either  going to  add  this  feature  or  this  feature,” not “Do   
you think  we should add this feature?”   
With, “We’re  going to  add  this  feature  _or_ this  feature,” you just discovered   
something  about  which  feature  really  matters  to  people.   
If  you say to people, “What should  we take away so we can add  this?” You’re  
starting  to  discover  what  really  matters  to  people.  But  you  never  want  to  get  to  the   
point where  there’s  a  democracy  deciding  what  you’re  offering.  The  minute  you  say   
“All  right  everybody  vote  what  I  should  do  next,”  then  you’re  not  adding  enough   
value to the people you’re leading.   
**When  was the  last  time  you  did  something for  the  first  time? **  
The notion that  as we cross 19-­‐years-­‐old we are instructed and encouraged to  
not  do  something  we  haven’t  done  before,  I  think  it’s  a  really  bad  thing.   
I  think  the  feeling  that  one  gets  from doing  the  new  thing,  from “this  might  not   
work,” is  what rewards  us  as  humans  and  amazingly  society  is  now  rewarding.   
I want you to think about, as  you go back through this  project that you just spent  
an  hour  analyzing  so  it  would  actually  ship,  what  if  you  built  in  four  more  weeks  of   
time  so  you  could  put  stuff  into  the  project  that  might  not  work?  What  if  you  invest   
an  enormous  amount  of  time  and  your  energy  to  do  something  in  the  world  that   
might  not  work?   
What professionals  do  is  they  stay  professionals  by  regularly  doing things  that  
require  emotional  labor—regularly doing  things  that  are  outside  their  comfort  zone.   
Yeah,  it  might  be  a  matter  of  life  and  death,  but  yes  I  still  want  my  neurosurgeon  to   
learn  something  new.  The  idea  that  that’s  why  we’re  doing  this  is  the  heart  of  this.   
You  don’t  need  this  if  you’re  making  chicken Florentine  every  single  night in a  
restaurant  because  you’ve  done  it  enough  times  that  yes,  it’s  going  to  come  out  in   
time  for  this  patron  to  be  happy.   
Who  needs  to  go  through  this—the  ShipIt Journal—this  is  all  about  “I’m doing   
this  because  I’ve  never done it  before.”   
**Shame and Vulnerability  **  
Then  to  wrap  up,  I  bring  up  the  thing  that  we’ve#160; underlined  so  much  of  today  and   
yesterday  which  comes  from Brene  Brown.  _Shame is  the project  killer._   
   
129   

* * *

   
   
The  fear  of  shame  is  what  people  use  to  keep  us  in  line.  It’s  what we use to keep  
women  in  line.  It’s  what  we  use  to  keep  the  underclass  in  line.  It’s  what  we  use  to   
keep each  other  in line.    
Don’t  get  up  and eat.   
Don’t  speak  up.   
You have  no  right to  do  that.    
People will  understand that  you’re unprepared.    
You  don’t  want  to  put  yourself  out  there  because  we  will  make  you  feel  shame.   
What we  do  with  our  projects  and  the  reason our  projects  are  late  is  because   
we’re  adding  all  this  fat  to  them to  protect  ourselves.  We’re  adding  all  this  insulation   
and  all these layers.    
**The  reason  we  use  100 words  to  answer  a  10-­word   
question  is  because  the  other  90 words  are  designed  
to  distract the  person  who  asked  us  the  question  so **  
**that we  never  have  to  say  the  10  words  that are  true. **  
We’re  afraid  that if  we  say  the  10  words  that  are  true,  the  person  might  actually   
hear what  we say and say, “You  should  be  ashamed  of  yourself.  You  should  be   
ashamed  that  you  didn’t  know  this.  Or  that  you  spoke  up  about  this.”   
It’s  so  much  easier  to  lay  90  words  of  other  stuff  on  top  of  it  and  committees  and   
subcommittees  and  “I  can’t  do  that  because…”  and  “You  don’t  know  my  real  thing…”   
Just  get  to  the  10  words  because  you  have  nothing  to  be  ashamed  of.  You  have   
trumped  the  shame  by  being  meaningful.  You  have  trumped  the  shame  by  going  into   
the  world  and  doing  something  that  needs  to  be  done  in  the  first  place.  And  how   
dare the critic who has never produced anything useful, _ever,_ stand up  and point  a   
finger at  you.    
How  dare  they  say  to  Jonah  Lehrer,  “Oh,  you  made  up  three  quotes  about  Bob   
Dylan,  therefore  you  should  be  ashamed  of  yourself.”   
This  guy  who  puts  himself  on  the  line  day  after  day  after  day  and  shares  and  puts   
stuff out  there—alright  your  jealous  of  him,  I  get  that,  but  how  dare  you  say  “He   
should  be  ashamed  of  himself,”  when  you  have never  been in his  shoes.    
We  just  have  to  let  go  of  this  and  we  have  to  say,  “I’m not  going  to  be  ashamed  of   
who  I  am and  what  I  care  about.  If  it’s  not  for  you,  you’re  a  non-­‐believer.”    
**Haters  gonna  hate.  Shun  the  non-­believers.  You can **  
**move  on. **  
   
130

“But  this  is  me.  This  is  what  I  believe  in  and  I  cared  enough  about  this  to  put  it  in   
the  world.  If  it’s  not  for  you,  that’s  ok.  But  I  will  not  accept  your  shame.  I’m being   
vulnerable  because  I  want  to  be  better  at  this,  but  you  may  not  give  me  your  shame   
in  return.  I’m just  not  going  to  take  it.  It’s  not  for  you  to  give  me.”   
Once  we  can  do  that,  we  can  fill  out  the  next  book  and  ship  the  next  thing.  And   
ship  the  next  thing.  And  over  time  the  foundation  gets  stronger  and  stronger  and   
you get  better at  it. Suddenly  your  dreams  become  projects  and  your  projects   
become  businesses  and  you  can  do  it  again.   
_That_ is why I do these events so that  you understand that  and so you can put   
stuff into the world.

**DISTINCT  AND DIRECT**   
**The  Benefits of  Having a  Reputation **  
I  would  argue  that  in  almost  every  failing  industry  the  people  in  the  top  get  hurt  last.   
So  you  can  milk  this  cow  for  a  really  long  time  to  come  if  you  choose.  But  a  big  part   
of  it  will  be  making  a  commitment  to  marketing yourself quite aggressively and  
changing  certain  parts  of  how  you  do  what  you  do  in  order  to  increase  your  market   
share  as  the  size  of  the  market  goes  down.   
When  we  saw  the  music  business  falling  apart,  Van  Morrison  is  one  of  the  last   
guys to get hurt. Even  though  the  number  of  records  that  get  bought  goes  down,   
people  are  still  going  to  buy  Moondance  for  a  long  time  to  come.   
If  your  Van  Morrison,  the  answer  isn’t  the  minute  the  music  business  is  in   
trouble  stop  being  in  the  music  business  and  open  a  bowling alley. The  answer   
might  be  double  down  on  the  music  business  and  understand  you  might  have  to  go   
tour  more  often.  You  might  have  to  figure  out  how  to  generate  different  streams  of   
income  to  make  up  for  the  fact.  But  it’s  easier  for  you  to  do  that  because  you’re  _Van  
Morrison_.  That’s  number  one.   
Number  two  is  I  don’t  think  there’s  ever  a  statement  about  good  or  bad  or  failure   
or non-­‐failure about  a  person’s decision to quit. This is strategy decision. It’s not  a   
morale  decision.   
If  you decide to quit to  go  do  something  else,  you  should  make  that  decision   
because  you  want  the  thrill  of  scaling  in  a  growing  market,  not  because  you  can’t   
think  of  how  to  make  the  existing  business  legit  going  forward.   
If  you love what you do, keep doing it and  grow it in a  different way because the  
industry is not  going to disappear for a  while.    
On  the  other  hand,  if  what  you  love  is  skiing  fresh  powder,  there’s  not  as  much   
fresh  powder  in  the  book  business  because  there’s  way  more  people  stamping  it   
down.  You  may  have  to  step  four steps over instead of one step  over.    
As  an  industry  starts  to  collapse,  there’s  no  question  there  are  more   
opportunities within that  industry and those opportunities tend to belong to the  
person with a track record.    
When  AOL  started  to  crumble,  because  AOL  was  my  biggest  customer,  I  had   
more  opportunities  to  do  stuff  with  AOL,  not  less  opportunities.   
AOL  said,  “We’re  going  from 100  projects  a  year  to  10.”   
Who  are  they  going to  give  the  10  to?    
   
132   

* * *

   
   
They’re  going  to  be  more  conservative  with  the  10.  So  they  are  more  likely  to   
give  it  to  me  because  I’m safer  than  they  are  to  give  it  to  some  guy  who  just  shows   
up.   
You  can  pick  up,  for  example,  a  lot  of  business  at  Microsoft  whose  business   
model  for  the  next  20  years  is  threatened.  But  they  have  20  years before it  goes  
away.  Someone  has  a  reputation  at  Microsoft.  Their  ability  to  go  in  there  and  get   
more  and  more  contracts  goes  up.  See  what  I  mean?   
That’s what  I was sort  of saying about  your industry. Not  that  you need to quit  it   
today, but you need  to  see that  it’s in disarray, that  the boat  is slowly sinking, that   
the  deck  chairs  are  up  for  grabs.  If  someone  who’s  calm,  who  stands  up  straight  and   
walks  in  and  starts  collecting  deck  chairs,  no  one’s  going  to  question  them because   
it’s the captain. Of course he’s  allowed  to take deck chairs.   
**Becoming a  Cash  Cow **  
No  money  means  every  time  someone  pays  you  $20,000  or  $50,000,  you’re  putting   
it  back  into  growing  your  company.  The  house  in  the  Hamptons  is  on  hold  for  a  long   
time  to  come.   
Because  what  your  market  likes  to  buy  is  expensive  stuff  from cash  cow  leaders.   
Your  market  isn’t  sitting  there  saying,  “Who’s  got  some  new  data  driven  way  we  can   
analyze  things  and  do  better  tomorrow?”  That’s  not  what  they’re  saying.   
If  you’re an insurgent brand, which you are,  insurgent  brands never spin  off  
cash.  Insurgent  brands  always  put  the  cash  into  becoming  cash  cow  brands.   
After  they’re  cash  cow  brands,  like  Nielson  or  comScore  is—I  mean  comScore   
hasn’t  done  anything  interesting  in  years.  No  one  wants  them to  do  anything  
interesting.  That’s  why,  not  because  they  suck.  Because  their  customers  suck.   
_**Q: Right.  So you  put  the  money back  into it.  So how  can  you  possibly not  go out   
and  raise  the  money? **_  
Because  raising  the  money  the  dip  in  of  itself.  The  people  who  are  waiting to   
invest  money  in  you  of  that  size  are  asking  for  something  you  don’t  have  right  now.   
They’re  asking  for  stuff  that’s  more  locked  down,  stuff  that’s  better  verified,  more   
clients,  more  cash  flow.   
This is like putting a  flyer into a  $100,000 web  start up. They  look at the  kind  of   
people  who  have  come  before  you  and  every  one  of  those  businesses  has  been   
boring, straightforward, and  accountant driven.    
The guys who built  SoundScan, the guys who built  Nielson, the guys who run the  
New  York  Times  bestseller  list—those  are  all  companies  run  by  accountants.   
They’re  not  run  by  some  guy  who’s  a  wild-­‐eyed visionary. The kind of person who’s  
going to fund you aren’t looking for  a wild-­‐eyed visionary.    
   
133   

* * *

   
   
All  I’m saying  is  if  you’re  waiting  for  the  $2  million  bucks  please  go  prove  me   
wrong.  Go  raise  the  $2  million  bucks.  If  you  can,  go  for  it.   
I’m just  saying  I  would  rather  see  you  do  your  dog  and  pony  show  for  customers   
than do  your  dog and  pony  show for  investors. The  dog and  pony  show is  going to   
be  very  similar  for  both,  but  the  customers  can  give  you  money  tomorrow  and  you   
don’t  have to pay it  back.    
**Coming Into  Your  Own **  
I  think  that  it  is  essential  that  you  do  not  rent  your  friends  from Facebook.  You  need   
to  have  a direct controlled  connection between you and  your friends and that  group  
of friends has to get  bigger. That  first  circle has to get  bigger. E-­‐mail  is  the  best  tool  I   
know, but if  you find  a better  tool that’s  fine.    
If  we look at Twitter  conversion versus  e-­‐mail  conversion,  if  we  send  out  a  link,   
e-­‐mail  is  10  to  20  times  better.  10-­‐20  times  as  many  people  will  click  on  a  link  in  an   
e-­‐mail  than  click  on  a  link  in  a  tweet.   
If  you build  this  connection where 100  or  a 1,000  or  10,000  people want to hear   
from you  by  e-­‐mail,  that  is  your  asset  going  forward.    
What I found  is  when everyone  can have  their  own TV  show, radio  show, or  the   
equivalent  online,  it’s  really  easy  to  decide  to  become  the  invisible  no  personality   
conduit.  It’s  just  showing  up  every  week,  but  it’s  really  me  or  Dan  or  Simon,  not  the   
host  who’s  saying  something  interesting.   
The  problem with  that  is  those  people  isn’t  really  adding  any  value  in  the  world   
because  the  reader  already  knows  where  to  find  me.  These  people  aren’t  showing   
the  guts  to  say,  “I  have  a  point  of  view.  I  have  something  to say.”    
Every  once  in  awhile  somebody  like  me  shows  up.   
**The  future  isn’t  that  we  need more  Charlie  Roses   
because  we  don’t.  What  we  need are  more  people   
who  actually  have  a  point  of  view and  are  worth **  
**following  for  themselves. **  
When all these  people  show up and  say, “Please  do  this. It will be  really  good  for   
you  and  I  have  400  listeners  or  400  readers.”  I’m like,  “I’m sorry.  I  don’t  want  to  be   
selfish,  but  no.  It  would  be  really  good  for  you  because  I  have  more  than  you  and  I   
know  you  want  me  to  link  to  it  when  we’re  done,  but  I  could  just  write  it  myself  if   
you  want  me  to  write  it  for  you.”   
That’s  why  my  advice  to  Stephanie  was  don’t  expect  that  the  people  who  came   
before  you  are  going  to  make  it  automatically  easy  for  you  to  have  their  readers.  The   
win  is  to  become  your  own  distinct  voice.

Stephanie  is  20  years  younger  than  the  rest  of  us.  She’s  from a  different  part  of   
the  world  than the  rest of  us. She  sees  the  world  differently  than the  rest of  us. We’re   
waiting  for  a  Stephanie,  not  somebody  who’s  just going to report what the old  white  
guys have to say.    
Tina  at  SwissMiss  now  has  more  readers  than  I  do.  If  she  comes  to  me  and  says,   
“I’d  like  to  ask  you  four  questions  about  your  new  book,”  just  selfishly,  never  mind   
my  part  that  I  like  Tina  to  succeed  because  she  came  from zero  to  that  many  in  no   
time;  I’m saying,  “Oh,  that’s  like  being  asked  to  be  on  TV.”  I’m more  likely  to  do  that   
because  those  are  new  readers,  more  people  who  are  there  to  hear  Tina,  not  there   
because  I’m there.  I’m honored  being  asked  to  do  that.   
And  it’s  not  just  a  numbers  game.  It’s  more  of  a  point  of  view  game.  When   
someone  has  a  distinctive  point  of  view—a Marc Maron or  a Bob Lefsetzs—those   
people  honor  you  more  when  they  want  to  talk  to  you  than  someone  who’s  just   
taking good  notes.   
**Selling to  VITO **  
This  is  a  simple  technique  that  only  works  for  Fortune  5000  corporations  or   
bureaucratic  non-­‐profits.  And  it  only  works  when  you  have  an  offer  of  significant   
benefit to  the  institution you’re  trying to  sell to. Those  are  the  two  key  pre-­‐cursors.  
But  that’s  fairly  common.   
What  you  do,  it’s  from a  book  called  “Selling To VITO”, you write a single page  
letter  that describes  not what is  on offer, but what sort of  offer  it is.    
Meaning,  “I  have  something  I  want  to  tell  you  about.  It  takes  10  minutes  and  it’s   
going to increase the sales of Microsoft Word by 15%.”    
Or,  “I’m launching  a  new  company.  It’s  in  the  intersection  of  this  and  this  and  I   
need to find out who at your  non-­‐profit  can  mention  what  we’re  doing.”   
It  leaves  mystery  to  the  question.    
It is  not enough of  a question that you can get a ‘no.’ “We thought about what you  
just said, the answer  is NO.”    
It’s,  “Are  you  interested  in  hearing  about  the  thing  that’s  behind  this  curtain?”  So   
that’s  the  question.    
Then what  you do is you use their website and you  find six  people in the  
organization  who  might  be  in  charge  of  the  answer  to  this  question.  Senior   
President  of this, Senior Vice President  of this, Director of this, Vice President  of  
that.  You  list  all  the  names  in  the  “To:”  line  of this letter. You print  six  copies and you  
highlight  one  name  for  each  of  the  six  copies.   
Then you take the six  letters (this still  works in the electronic world) and you  
put  them into  six  interoffice  mail  yellow  things  with  the  names  or  into  plain

envelopes  and  you  write  the  person’s  name  on  the  envelope.  So  now  you  have  six   
envelopes—Steve  Ballmer,  Bill  Gates,  Blah,  Blah,  Blah.  Six  envelopes.   
Then  you  call  the  company,  so  far  you’ve  invested  two  minutes  of  your  time,  and   
you  ask  for  the  mailroom.  Whoever answers the phone  in  the  mailroom you  say,   
“What’s  your  name?”  and  the  guy  tells  you  his  name.  You  say,  “Thank  you  very   
much,”  and  you  hang-­‐up.    
And  you  get  a  FedEx  envelope  and  you  FedEx  the  guy  in  the  mailroom the  six   
envelopes with a  postage that  says “Please Distribute.”   
What  happens  is  it’s  his  job  to  distribute  them.  Six  of  these  letters  get  delivered   
to  the  six people  you’re  trying to  reach. We  know that they’re  going to  get delivered.    
The person opens it. They see the other five people who got  the letter. There is   
no recourse other  than contacting the other  five people to find out who’s going to  
handle  this.  Because  they  don’t  want  to  write  you  a  “Yes,  I  want  to  take  a  meeting”   
only  to  find  out  that  someone  else  wrote  them a  “No,  go  away”  or  the  three  of  them  
offered  you  separate  meetings.   
So one guy gets assigned to deal with you and often that person will either  call  
you or send a note saying, “What’s up?”   
What you’ve  just done  is  you’ve  found  one  person who’s  willing to  give  you one-­‐  
minute  to  find  out what it is  that you have  that they  really  need  to  hear  about. Now  
it’s up to you.    
It’s  so  much  more  effective  than  spamming  people  with  their  e-­‐mail  or  leaving   
100  messages  on  their  voicemail  system.  What  you’ve  done  is  respected  the   
hierarchy  and  everyone  in  the  system has  done  what  they  need  to  do.   
It’s  not  something  I  do  very  often,  but  every  time  I  ever  did  it,  it  worked.  Selling   
to  VITO—the  entire  book is  that.   
**Paying the  Price  Early **  
It  depends  on  what  you  and  your  family  need  for  piece  of  mind.  My  basic  suggestion   
for  the  typical  person  who  wants  to  do  this  is  to  act  like  you  have  no  money  now.   
Eat black beans  and  rice every single night, never  go to a restaurant, never  go to  
a  movie,  move  to  a  smaller  house,  sell  your  car,  get  a  used  thing—just cut your  costs  
to  zero  while  you’re  still  making  what  you’re  making  now  and  take  80%  or  90%  of   
the  money  and  just  pay  it  into  an  account.   
Get  the  number  in  the  account  to  where  you,  your  spouse,  and  family  will  be   
happy  for  X  number  of  months  without  any  income.  It  might  be  that  you  have  to  do   
this  for  three  years  before  the  amount  of  money  in  that  account  is  big  enough.  But   
you’re still  eating black  beans and rice every single night.

You’re  paying the  price  early, not paying it late. Then there  will  come  a  day  when   
you  say,  “The  combination  of  my  freelance  income,  my  project  income,  and  my  hope   
is  greater  than  my  need  for  this  other  thing  I  have  going  on.”   
When  that  moment  comes,  then  with  a  happy  heart  you  can  go  and  take  the  leap.   
It’s  so  much  easier  today  to  make  money  from multiple  streams  of  income  than  it   
was  20  years  ago.  There  are  lot’s  of  ways  you  can  string  together  Saturday  morning   
work, Sunday  work, evening work so  that it gets  closer  and  closer  to  the  day  you can  
say, “I  don’t  need the security of _this_ paycheck.”    
But if  you have  a spouse, it’s  really their  call because  if  they’re  not in, it’s  painful  
to  take  the  leap when they’re  not ready.”   
**Beachheads **  
I  think  a  lot  of  this  depends  on  the  industry.  It’s  really  easy  to  imagine  the   
beachhead.   
When  I  was  at  Yoyodyne  and  we  signed  up  American  Express  and  Proctor  and   
Gamble,  I  was  like  what  else  do  you  want?   
We  were  going to  MasterCard  next and  they  looked  at us  and  said, “We  don’t  
care.  We  don’t  care  that  American  Express  is  a  happy  customer  who  wrote  you  a   
testimony.  We  don’t  care  that  Proctor  and  Gamble  is  in.”   
Suddenly  my  beachhead  wasn’t  worth  a  thing  except  that  they paid their bills.    
It’s  very  easy  to  seduce  yourself  into  thinking  there  is  this  magic  customer.  I’m  
not  sure  in  many  industries  it  works  that  way  quite  like  it  used  to.   
Technology industries are a  little different  because there are people in the  
technology  business  who  want  their  competitors  to  adopt  you.  They  will  actively   
promote  you  because  they  want  everyone  to  be  digitizing  this  or  working  this  way.   
It  helps  them.   
But  in  general,  I  think  a  customer  is  a  customer  and  a  cash  flow  beats  a  
beachhead  any  day. Once  you have  enough  cash  flow, then you have  the  power  to   
look a prospect in the  eye  and  say, “Maybe  this  isn’t for  you,” and  start leaving.   
When you say  that, all bets  are  off. They  chase  you. They’re  like, “What? You can  
live  without us?” Suddenly  they  want to  work with  you.   
**Interact  with the Market  Early **  
As  I  talked  about  in  the  ShipIt  thing,  you  can’t  have  a  beautiful  website  that  includes   
everything.  On  the  same  day  you  could  have  just  your  blog.  One  would  take  a  year   
and  one  would take a  week.    
   
137   

* * *

   
   
**There’s  almost  nothing  that’s  worth  waiting  a  year  for   
if the  alternative  is  to  go  for  a  week  and  interact with **  
**the  market. **  
The  people  who  come  to  me  and  say,  “I’ve  just  spent  four  years  writing  this  book.   
Now  I  need to start  a  blog,”  have  made  a  huge  mistake.   
They should have spent  four years writing their blog and now  they’re going to  
write  a book. The  four  years  they  were  silent were  four  years  they  didn’t get to   
interact  with  the  people  who  could  trust  them now  that  they’re  ready  to  have a  
book.   
For  you,  there  are  only  225  people  who  trust  you.  Your  number  one  goal  is  to  get   
to  2,000  people  who  trust  you  and  you  need  to  start  tomorrow.  A beautiful  website   
is fine, but  it’s not  going to be worth waiting for if you haven’t  already built  your  
way  to  the  2,000.   
**Getting Legal **  
As  someone  who’s  married  to  a  lawyer,  friends  with  former  lawyers,  lived  in  a  law   
school  dorm for  a  year—when  I  was  in  college  my  partner,  I,  and  a  third  guy  started   
a  company.  We  raised  $5,000  from each  other  to  start  it and  spent $3,000  on legal  
fees. It  was so stupid.   
A legal  document  might  be  an  important  marketing  tool  in  certain  business  cases   
or  at  a  skateboarding  park  where  the  presence  of  a  dense  block  of  text  makes  you   
look  more  official.  If  that’s  the  case,  you  might  want  to  buy  that  or  get  a  facsimile  by   
stealing  it  because  stealing  legal  documents  is  always  a  fine  thing  to  do.   
But,  generally,  the  goal  is  to  not  get  sued,  not  to  have  a  legal  document  in  case   
you  get  sued.  You  can  write  a  legal  document  that  will  help  you  not  get  sued.  And  the   
way  you do  that is  two  things.    
One, you write  it in really clear  English  so  you both  know what you actually  
agreed  on.  That  dramatically  decreases  the  chance  you’re  going  to  get  sued.   
Most  of  the  time  people  sue  it’s  because  they are  hurt and  angry not because   
they  think  they  can  make  money.  If  they  know  what  they  signed,  they’re  way  less   
likely  to  feel hurt and  angry  because  they  know what they  signed.    
And  number  two,  which  I’ve  been  using  forever,  is  you  put  a  clause  in that says,  
“Any  disagreements  we  will  settle  by  binding  informal  arbitration.  You  pick  a   
lawyer. I pick a lawyer. The  two  lawyers  pick a third  lawyer. That lawyer  spends   
three  hours  looking  at  memos  that  we  both  write  and  decide  who’s  right.  End  of   
discussion.”   
Once  that’s  in there  then both  sides  understand  they can’t outspend  the  other   
one because the whole transaction is only going to cost  $1,800—three  hours  of  this   
   
138

lawyers  time.  Rather  than  risk  a  crapshoot  at  that,  they  try  to  find  a  way  to  agree   
with  each  other  because  it’s  just not worth  it. They  know they  can’t bully  their  way   
to  victory  if  they’re  wrong.    
The  combination  of  “Look,  I’m me  and  this  is  what  we’re  agreeing  on,  and  by  the   
way  if  I  missed  something,  we’ll  settle  it  this  way,”  really  goes a  long way to helping  
you out.   
The last  thing I would say is as you go forward and get  bigger, what  you want  is a   
lawyer  who  works  with  you the  following way:   
You  write  down  what  you  want  an  agreement  to  do.  You  do  all  the  hard  work  of   
saying you  want  it  to  do.  And  then  you  go  to  the  lawyer  and  say,  “All  I  am paying  you   
to  do  is  make  an  agreement  that  does  this.  I’m not  asking  your  advice  about  how  I   
should  win.  I’m just  asking  you  to  make  the  agreement  do  this.”   
And  it’s  going  to  be  a  long  time  before  you need what  Google has. Google has so  
many  millions  of  users  that  they  have  to  worry  about  edge  cases.   
  You  don’t  have  to  worry  about  edge  cases  because  the  combination  of  your   
handshake  and  your  arbitration  eliminates  all  of  that.  But  I’m not  a  lawyer  and  if  I’m  
wrong,  I  don’t  want  to  hear  from you.   
**Being Memorable **  
The  thing  about  the  vast  majority  of  imprinted  junk  is  it’s  invisible.  The  reason  it’s   
invisible is because it’s expected.    
Think  about  everybody  here.  How  many  people  in  this  room did  you  shake   
hands  with?  Almost  everybody.  How  many  do  you  remember  shaking  hands  with?   
No one. Because hand shakes are invisible.    
On the  other  hand  if  when you shake  hands  with  people  you’re  going  like this   
\[exaggerated  hand  shake\],  people  are  going  to  remember  that  for  a  really  long  time   
because  you  did  something  that  was  unexpected.   
When  you  came  to  something  with  only  20  people  in  it,  you  didn’t  expect  a   
custom mug  with  the  agenda  on  it.  That’s  why I did  it that way.    
Think  about  how  are  you  going  to  give  something  to  people  that  they  are  going   
to  remember.   
For  example,  you  could  go  to  the  bank  and  get  one  hundred  Susan  B.  Anthony   
dollars.  Or  not  even  Susan  B.  Anthony,  but  go  to  a  coin  store  and  pay $2  for  a  
hundred John F. Kennedy big giant  things.    
When  people  say,  “What  are  you  doing?”  you  hand  them a  big  fat  coin.  It  doesn’t   
even  have  your  name  on  it.   
And  they  say,  “What’s this?”   
   
139   

* * *

   
   
Now  you  have  a  chance  to  tell  them a  story.  I  can’t  off  the  top  of  my  head  think   
why  you  would  give  them a  Susan  B.  Anthony  dollar,  but  you  could  probably  come   
up with a good  one.    
And  what  are  they  going  to  do?  Spend  it?  No,  they’re  not  going  to  spend  it.  They   
might  make  it  their  good  luck  coin.  In  fact  you  could  say,  “Always  keep  this  in  your   
pocket because blah, blah, blah.”    
In  my  bag  there  is  a  coin  I  gave  to  every  single  person  the  day  I  sold  my  company   
and  there’s  a  guy  Ted,  I  see  him in  New  York  probably  once  a  year  at  random on  the   
street, and it’s been 10 years.  Every  single  time  he  reaches.  He  still  has  it  and  he  can   
tell  me  the  story  I  told  him when  I  gave  him the  coin.   
The  point  is  it  doesn’t  have  to  be  some  fancy  thing  from China  or  imprinted.   
It can be an object.    
It can be a Popsicle stick.    
And  you’re just  always giving out  lollipops or popsicle sticks and there’s a  story  
with  it.  That  is  the  icebreaker  that  you  use  to  be  memorable  as  opposed  to  all  that   
trade  show  junk  that  means  absolutely  nothing.   
**Naming a  Business **  
Ok so  I have  three  posts  about this  so  you  can  Google  it  on  my  site.  The  short  version   
is  you  start  with  two  kinds  of  names.  Names  that  mean  something.  Names  that  don’t.   
Names  that  don’t:  Amazon,  Starbucks,  Nike,  Apple.  They  don’t  mean  anything   
until  the  company  comes  to  exist.   
Whereas  WorkFlow,  I’m making  that  one  up,  a  company  that  does  work  flow   
solutions  mean  something  before  the  company  even  existed.   
If  you  come  up  with  a  fanciful  name  it’s  a  blank  slate  and  you  get  to  fill  it  with   
meaning.  The  bad  news  is  for  the  first  year  you  have  to explain what you do.   
On  the  other  hand  if  you  come  up  with  a  name  that  means  something,  then  you   
don’t  have  to  explain  as  much  in  the  beginning  what  you’re  doing.  It  fits  into  a  box.   
The  vernacular  in  an  industry  matters.   
On  the  web  if  you  have  a  name  that  means  something,  people  don’t  think  as   
much  of  you  in  the  investment  community  because  all  the  people  who  came  before   
you—the  Googles, the  Yahoos, the  eBays—didn’t  mean  anything.   
So  when  you  say,  “We  are  SalesForce.com,”  I’m like,  “Oh,  you  must  not  be  a big  
idea  because  you  told  me  what  you  do  already.”  The  position  in  the  minds  of  the   
investor  /  journalist  shifts  based  on  which  name  you  pick.

The  second  thing  is  URLs  still  matter  because  a  lot  of  people  who  don’t  know   
how  they work  won’t  know  to type  .ly  at  the  end  or  whatever.  There’s  still  more   
value  for  a  consumer  brand  that  ends  in  .com.   
Then you have to think  about  “What  can I get?”   
Every English word, every one with six or  fewer  letters  is  taken and  I think seven  
or fewer letters is taken. Every single word. So it’s going to be expensive, but  you  
might  decide  it’s  worth  it  to  go  buy  this.   
I’m going  to  tell  you  the  10-­‐second version that  Squidoo was going to be called  
Fisheye.  And  Fisheye.com was  taken.   
The guy owned a  fishing boat  in the Caribbean  and  I  offered  him $10,000  for   
Fisheye.com and  he  said  “No”  because  it  was  the  name  of  his  one  fishing  boat.   
Anyway,  my  flight  got  canceled.  I  misdirected  my  plans.  I  ended  up  on  the   
Cayman  Islands  teaching  my  son  how  to  scuba  dive.  It  was  right  after  a  hurricane.   
We  were  driving to  the  hotel and  shipwrecked  on the  shore  I saw the  Fisheye, the   
boat. Literally. I saw  the  boat.  True  story.  But  by  then  I  already  named  the  company   
Squidoo so Fisheye didn’t happen.    
The  easiest  way  to  get  a  domain  is  to  take  two  English  words  and  put  them  
together.  Redeye.  Fisheye.  Upsidedown.  Thisiswherethecoolpeoplehangout.com.   
  Length isn’t your  issue. Length is free. You can have it be as long as you want _as_  
_long  as  we can  remember  it._   
Again,  depending  on  how  big  you  want  to  be  and  how  your  want  your  customers   
to  perceive  you  early  on;  you’re  going  to  pick  a  name  that  satisfies  those  goals.   
You  will  not  listen  to  your  family.   
You  will  not  listen  to  your  trademark  lawyer.   
You will not listen to  anybody  who  thinks  they  should  tell you stuff.    
Everyone  has  an  opinion  about  your  name  and  especially  about  your  logo.  It’s   
none  of  their  business.  Ignore  them.  That’s  not  the  point.  They  don’t  know  what  it’s   
going  to  mean,  the  same  way  you  don’t  have  a  poll  before  you  name  your  kid.  You   
just  name  your  kid  and  their  name  comes  to  mean  something  over  time.   
**Final Words **  
Ok, so  on that note  we’re  going to  wrap up for  the  day. The  last thing I want to  say to   
you is—I  made  a  t-­‐shirt  for  my  new  book.  I’m going  to  show  you  what  it  says  and  I   
think you’re  all ready  to  hear  it. This  is  where  you need  to  head.
